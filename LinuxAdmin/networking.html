    <ul>
        <li>Networking and Distributions</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a huge amount of variability by distro</li>
                <li>Some rewrite the config by script every boot</li>
                <li>Some have a specialized app</li>
                <li>In general it's better to use what's built in where possible. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Where to start</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Setting IP addresses</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Static vs dynamic</li>
                        <li>Example: as admin, should you have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220910094157/https://ostechnix.com/configure-static-ip-address-linux-unix/">static IP</a> address in case you need to seriously lock down the server during a hack?</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Setting DNS</li>
                <li>Naming interfaces</li>
                <li>IPv4 vs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220525110822/https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/network_administration_guides/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/index.html">IPv6</a></li>
                <li>There are lots of great references online for refreshers, for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220714164409/https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/linux_network_administrators_guide/index.html">This One</a> that go into great depth on linux network administration</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Examples</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Red Hat</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Differences in version (Red Hat 7 vs Read Hat 9) means you need to check your version</li>
                        <li>Default service in Red Hat 9 is NetworkManager</li>
                        <li>Red Hat 9 networking info lives in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ </li>
                        <li>Multiple tools are built in such as systemctl and nmcli</li>
                        <li>*Caution* Modification of most of the built in tools will mean Red Hat no longer with warranty or support your system</li>

                <li>Debian</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>/etc/network/interfaces is the config file</li>
                        <li>/etc/resolve.conf is for the nameservers</li>
                        <li>Resolveconf is a program (Different then resolve.conf) that works on the resolve.conf file</li>
                        <li>Resolveconf is optional</li>
                        <li>There is a GUI, but automatic network config tools are NOT for servers, desktop users only</li>

        <li>Troubleshooting</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>One way to start troubleshooting is by model layer</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Network access or Physical layer: Is the cable unplugged? Is the interface up?</li>
                        <li>Data link Layer: did the ARP entry come up correctly?</li>
                        <li>Networking/Internet layer: Do you have a unique IP address? Is your DNS correct?</li>
                        <li>Transport layer: Is the correct port open?</li>
                        <li>Application layer: Is the program I'm trying to use installed? Updated? Is the Daemon running?</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>A second way to start troubleshooting is to ask questions of yourself and the server</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why am I unable to ping a known address?</li>
                        <li>What's my error message?</li>
                        <li>What's the most common issues and have I checked them?</li>
                        <li>What changed from the last time I used this machine?</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
    </ul>   
<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>On each of your servers install the networking Tools, the package is called net-tools.  Try one of the commands to make sure the install went well.</li>
        <li>Read through <a href=" https://web.archive.org/web/20220602224947/https://www.tecmint.com/linux-networking-commands/">This article</a> and try out several of the commands on each server, making note of what you're seeing and if you have to make any changes to get each command to work</li>
        <li>Start up one of your servers, and find where your server keeps the networking info.  Pull up the documentation, look at the config file/script/tool, explore around the file system. Make notes with answers to the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>What do you see?</li>
                <li>Where is your networking info located?</li>
                <li>Does it use a script?</li>
                <li>Conf file?</li>
                <li>Tool?</li>
                <li>Special commands?</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Complete the lab that is found on <a href="/LinuxAdmin/labexcercises/networking.pdf">This PDF</a> Make sure you are paying careful attention to the requirements.
        </li>

    <ul>
        <li>What is Grep?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>grep is a pattern matching tool</li>
                <li>grep can be used as a search tool</li>
                <li>grep can use Regular Expressions (regex) to help find more complex patterns</li>
                <li>grep can be used with pipe or by itself to search the contents of files</li>
                <li>There are different forms of grep, so it's important to make sure you know which one you're using and why</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What is Grep good at?</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Pattern matching</li>
                <li>Pattern matching using plain text or regex</li>
                <li>Finding things that either match a pattern, or everything that doesn't match a pattern</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What is Grep not so good at?</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Reading minds, grep is very literal and will find exactly what you tell it to even if "that's not really what you meant"</li>
                <li>Anything that isn't pattern matching, so grep is not good at replacements, substitutions, sorting or anything like that</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Some examples of how to use grep</li>  
            <ul>
                <li> cat file | grep pattern</li>
                <li>grep file pattern</li>
                <li>grep file option pattern</li>
                <li>grep pattern file | grep secondPattern</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>What is a Repository (repo)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A way to collect and organize software</li>
                        <li>Also known as a way to collect packages</li>
                        <li>Personal Package Archive (PPA)</li>
                        <li>Source of software compatible with your system</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Why do we have them</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy way to organize software</li>
                        <li>Can split software by version, or kernel, etc.</li>
                        <li>Helps keep you using compatible software</li>
                        <li>Can also host OS updates</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Some common repos you might see and use</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard and non-standard repositories</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Standard comes with the machine (should work without issue)</li>
                                <li>Non-standard must be added separately (Who knows?)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Ubuntu has some extras/different vocab</li>

                                <li>Universe (community maintained and open source)</li>
                                <li>Multiverse (Restricted by copyright/legal)</li>

                                <li>Restricted - propriety, may include device drivers</li>

                <li>How to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220115224353/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3305810/how-to-list-repositories-on-linux.html">add a repository</a> (needs sudo)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CentOS https://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories</li>
                        <li>OpenSuse - zypper addrepo</li>
                        <li>Mandriva - urpmi.addmedia</li>
                        <li>Debian or Ubuntu - open and edit "/etc/apt/sources.list"</li>
                        <li>Fedora -"/etc/yum.repos.d/"</li>

            </ul>
        <li>Repository Safety</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Adding unknown repositories represent a safety risk because they can install things on your system and update/change your OS</li>
                <li>Equivalent of saying yes please give randomprogram full admin rights</li>
                <li>Do you trust the person hosting the repo/PPA?</li>
                <li>How many people have (safely) used this repo/PPA before you?</li>
                <li>How up  to date is this repo/PPA?</li>
                <li>Can you troubleshoot when something goes wrong?</li>
                <li>Is this repo/PPA still in testing, or production ready?</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Patches, updates and upgrades</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Testing! Oh so much testing must be done!</li>
                <li>A patch fixes a critical error generally in a specific spot</li>
                <li>Update gets the latest version but doesn't install (do this first)</li>
                <li>Upgrade installs newest version</li>
                <li>Install package-name installs or updates to latest version</li>
                <li>Server Admins usually test updates and patches before sending them company wide</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Windows Patch Tuesday disasters</li>
                        <li>Can break your system and be incompatible with programs you have installed</li>
                        <li>Not unheard of for patches/updates to cripple a system</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>There are many resources with examples on how to do installs at the command prompt such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220902132356/https://www.control-escape.com/linux/lx-swinstall.html">Example 1</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220616153302/https://opensource.com/article/18/8/how-install-software-linux-command-line">Example 2</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220906202310/https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-install-software-linux-introduction/">Example 3</a></li>

<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>On your own server, Make a bunch of files and folders, then try to create a group, add a user to the system then add the user to your group.  Make sure to check the user can login.  Now try each of the chmod, chgrp, chown commands</li>
        <li>On both of your servers, go find the system files and special files and make note of thier location and if they have any differences to the list above, such as name, location, or function.</li>
        <li>Try creating a script for your server to Backup using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220425112234/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3328840/working-with-tarballs-on-linux.html">tar</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0EK6PmKRCU">Adrianna's video on how to use tar</a>).</li>
        <li>Go through both of your servers and make notes on What repositories are already on your system, where you found your list of repositories, and why you might want to add a repository to your system</li>
        <li>Try creating a script to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220607232203/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3330497/linux-commands-for-measuring-disk-activity.html">monitor disk activity</a> on your system for all users and another for some users.</li>
    </ul>

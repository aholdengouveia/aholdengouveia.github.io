    <ul>
        <li>What is Documentation?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A written reference that can be easily shared with others</li>
                <li>Explanations and helpful hints/tips/tricks</li>
                <li>A way to share information with others asynchronously, can be written, recorded, screenshots, diagrams and other visual or oral representations of information</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Why is Documentation Important?</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Documentation can be useful for you to have a record of what you've done</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This could be accomplishments in your career <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220613151917/https://lifehacker.com/keep-track-of-your-work-accomplishments-throughout-the-1823436243">for things like reviews, promotions or raises</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220831184733/https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-10minute-weekly-activity-that-helps-you-get-ahead-worksheet-included">Activity including a worksheet to track accomplishments</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Documentation can also be useful as a way to share information with others when you are unavailable (vacation, ill, job change) or  just when you aren't easily accessible</li>
                <li>Documentation is a record, so everyone can be on the same page for what's going on, or who's in charge, or even how things are setup to keep consistency</li>
                <li>Having well put together documentation can also help if you need to know something and don't know who to ask.</li>
                <li>Example: You are the server admin for Acme, you've decided to take a week off, you need to document your server setup, maintenance, Points of contact for different scenarios, emergency plan, and backup information so it can be shared with your department/area/NOC/SOC because you want to have an actual vacation without panicked phone calls</li>
                <li>Example: You've put together a new project you're excited about and what the whole company to use, but you don't want to have individual meetings or presentations to show how everything works, so you create a wiki (yes that can be documentation too!) with information including FAQs and updates as people ask questions and you continue working on your project</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How to tell if Documentation is considered "good" and where to start</li>

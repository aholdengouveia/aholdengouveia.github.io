    <ul>
        <li>What is Sed?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sed is a stream editor</li>
                <li>Most popular use is substitutions</li>
                <li>Sed can support Regular Expressions (regex)</li>
                <li>Sed is considered non-destructive, that means be default it doesn't change the original file</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What is Sed good at?</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Substitutions</li>
            <li>Seeing what a file can look like without damaging the original</li>

        </ul>
        <li>What is Sed not so good at?</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting the file</li>
            <li>Easy to understand error messages, it's also not as well documented as it could be</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Some examples of how to use sed as shown in the video</li>  
            <ul>
                <li>sed s/originalTerm/NewTerm/ filename</li>
                <li>You can also put the results in a file if you don't want to show them on screen only using append (>>) and Redirect (>) sed s/originalTerm/NewTerm/ filename >> newFileWithChanges</li>
                <li>sed</li>
                <li>To have a global substitution instead of first instance only, you add the g at the end "sed s/o/0/g filename"</li>
                <li>We can make sed print lines matching the pattern instead of substitutions by doing "sed -n '/MA/ p' filename"</li>
                <li>We can have multiple instances of sed as well by doing something like "sed s/0/o/g filename | sed s/3/s/g"</li>
            </ul>

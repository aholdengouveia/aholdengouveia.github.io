\subsection*{Please include the command, a screenshot showing it works as intended, cite all sources you used, and give a short explanation of how the command works and why.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Print all lines containing the string Lane
        \item Print all lines where the person's first name starts with H
        \item Print all lines ending in three zeros (000)
        \item Print all lines that don't contain 408
        \item Print all lines where birthdays are in the year 1935 (be careful of the date format! it's MM/DD/YY)
        \item Print all lines where the phone number is in an area code that starts with an 8
        \item Print all lines containing an uppercase letter, followed by 4 lowercase letters, a space and one uppercase letter.
        \item Print lines where the address begins with a two or three digit number (so this would be 12 main st or 123 main street but not 1234 main street).
        \item Print lines where the person lives in Mass or Illinois
        \item Print lines containing the addresses that aren't on a street (You might see St as shorthand for street)


    \end{enumerate}



\section*{Deliverables}
A text document with the grep statements used to get each result.  Clearly labeled so I can see which answer goes to which question.


Please include the command, a screenshot that includes the command and a few results showing it works as intended, cite all sources you used, and give a short explanation of how the command works and why. Make sure everything is in your own words.  Think of the explanation as you trying to walk someone through how to use grep when they haven't heard of it before.

\section*{Deliverables}
A text document with the awk statements used to get each result.  Clearly labeled so I can see which answer goes to which question.


Please include the command, a screenshot that includes the command and a few results showing it works as intended, cite all sources you used, and give a short explanation of how the command works and why. Make sure everything is in your own words.  Think of the explanation as you trying to walk someone through how to use awk when they haven't heard of it before.

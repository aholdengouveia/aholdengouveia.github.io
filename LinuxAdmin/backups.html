                    <li>Copy of our data/apps/settings/etc</li>
                    <li>Can be local or offsite</li>
                    <li>Can be on multiple types of hardware</li>
                    <li>Third party services that provide backups</li>
                    <li>Backups are forDisasters (natural and unnatural), Accidents, and Incidents </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Types and Guidelines</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Incremental backups - only files since last backup (most frequent)</li>
                    <li>Full backups - copy of all files (medium frequency)</li>
                    <li>Forensic Copy (Least frequent)</li>
                    <li>Frequency is based on company, industry, personal risk profile and what you're willing to lose</li>
                    <li>Backing up more than just servers, config files, applications, changes, users and more</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Is your backup working?</li>
                    <li>How often do you check the backup happened and works?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Such as once a year on May 4th (Star wars days)</li>

                    <li>Where is it stored?</li>    
                    <li>How is it stored?</li>
                    <li>Is it documented?</li>
                    <li>Did we update the documentation?</li>
                    <li>Review backup policy and what's being backed up frequently (at least once a year)</li>

          Now that you have a resume you should start to work on your interview skills. There are a couple kinds of interviews out there, the ones we'll focus on are technical style interviews (including white board style interviews for programmers) and HR style interviews. Both come with different expectations and sets of questions

          Once you have made a great impression at your interview, you should send a thank you note and start thinking about job offers.  Job offers, how to accept, decline and negotiate are important and big topics!  For negotiation <a href="https://www.keirstenbrager.tech/salarytips-part1/">I want to refer you to someone that did an amazing job writing up how to do this </a>   To accept or decline or negotiate you need to understand everything that's being offered to you.  Total compensation can include everything from salary to benefits, stock options to bonuses and it's important you understand what each of those things means.

        But most important, <strong>if it's not in writing it's not real. </strong> Make sure everything you want is in writing, never ever go on verbal agreement in a job offer.  EVER.

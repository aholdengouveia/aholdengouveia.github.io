    I have been working as a teacher for a number of years. One of the things that's amazing about being a teacher is that it is literally my job to learn about new things and share those with others.  I love to create curriculum so that I can share what I've learned with the most people.  At Northern Essex Community College I have created numerous courses, both completely from scratch for updating our degrees, and also redoing courses to stay up to date on what industry wants the most. I try and make sure I stay up to date and relevant for what my students need for the job market today <em>and </em> tomorrow.

    I like to work in a lot of different languages, different types of projects and branch out as far as I can from what might be considered traditional CS.  I love to make things and encourage others to make things too.  I have campaigned for a maker-space at NECC for a number of years and was able to get funding for a 3D printer to spark interest in making things for my students.  I also like to spend my summers learning new things like application development, <!--insert codename:Adulting app link--> Web development and even hardware design.  I think everything can be integrated in new and interesting ways. My Curriculum Vitae (CV) is at the bottom of this page if you are interested in learning more about my background as an educator and what I do at work.

    Part of learning new things for me is going to conferences and seeing what everyone else is doing, not just in CS and cybersecurity but also learning about what's going on in the world.  If you're interested in my travels to conferences you can follow my twitter <!--Follow me on Twitter Button-->

    <ul>
        <li>Data, What's the point?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Data can be used by people or companies to make choices about their behaviors in the future, or to look back on what choices they've made</li>
                <li>Even things like budgets are based on data you've collected even if you didn't realize it (going back through previous bills is data collection)</li>
                <li>The better we can understand and collect our data, the better our choices can be</li>
                <li>The better our data the more accurate our predictions and past trends will be</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How to think about data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Why we gather data</li>
                <li>Data can be used in a variety of applications from predicting what a store should stock based on previous sales, to what the weather could be like next week</li>
                <li> Is your data discrete or continuous?</li>
                <li>How should your data be organized in general?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Group books by Genre? Or Trope? Recommended age range?</li>
                        <li>For example, Don't have a column "Money" when you could split out sales and profits.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230315032809/https://bookdown.org/brianmachut/uofm_analytics_r_hw_sol_2/dsm.html">Data and Problem solving</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>First steps are to define the problem and outline your process to solve, Make sure to include what a "success" means!</li>
                <li>Collect and structure your data</li>
                <li>Visualize and analyze your data</li>
                <li>Decide how the data can change your next step</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Collect your data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Data can be collected Manually or automatically</li>
                <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231009033457/https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-collection-methods">Data collection Methods</a></li>
                <li>When data is collected, it's important to pay attention to the form</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Celsius vs Fahrenheit, or meters vs feet</li>
                        <li>Make sure to collect the same data (if it's books, collect title AND author not OR author)</li>
                        <li>Make sure format such as text, or integer or float is consistent</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Data accuracy is important!  Don't fudge or make things up.  Blank is better than inaccurate</li>
                <li>Measure all data in the same way (if you use a ruler make sure you are consistent with where you consider the "start")</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Structure your data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure it's in the same order so you don't have confusion of things like title vs author vs editor</li>
                <li>If data is starting in something like a spreadsheet, rows vs columns is important!</li>
                <li>Data labels are important, make sure each row, column or other is clearly labeled</li>
                <li>You may want to specify the type of data expected, such as text, or single char, or integer, or float.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://databox.com/how-to-analyze-data">Analyze your data</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Data analysis is where we collect, process, define, and clean our data so that we can finally do something with it</li>
                <li>Data analysis can be done visually by a human to see trends, or with large computer programs if our data set is too big for a person (most common)</li>
                <li>The type of analysis we do will depend on the data</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numbers might use a statistical analysis, and would should trends like less books borrowed on a Tuesday</li>
                        <li> Text analysis might show trends such as people are less satisfied with their books in January because the reviews contain more negative words</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Vizualize your data</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230331161701/https://www.oldstreetsolutions.com/good-and-bad-data-visualization">When and how to vizualise your data</a></li>
                <li>How we can take numbers, or text, or data and present it in a way it's easier for humans to see</li>
                <li>This can be done in graphs, or charts to show trends</li>
                <li>Data visualization is important to make sure other people can follow what's going on in your data, BUT it can be manipulated!</li>
                <li>Data visualizations can show anything depending on bias</li>
                <li>Data visualizations can be good or bad, confusing or clear, depending on the choices you make</li>
                <li>Everything from colour, to size of visual, to measurements matter!</li>
                <li>Raw data is unlikely to be helpful when looked at</li>
                <li><a href="https://viz.wtf/">Examples of Horrible data visualizations</a></li>
            </ul>
        <li>Decide how your data informs next steps</li>
            <ul>
                <li>What is your goal with your data</li>
                <li>Do you want to show sales in the month to see when you need more hours worked? More stock ordered? More employees on call? Different kinds of stock?</li>
                <li>Is the data you've gathered and analyzed enough or do you need more? Does monthly make sense? Yearly?  Daily? What's reasonable for your goal?</li>
                <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210922041226/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-descriptive-and-predictive-data-mining/">Difference Between Descriptive and Predictive Data Mining</a></li>
            </ul>
        <li>Descriptive data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is about how we describe and summarize our data</li>
                <li>This type of data might show anomalies and past trends</li>
                <li>Might be used to  generate reports on previous behaviors or see if there is a potential correlation (such as people buy less books during wage downturns)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Predictive Data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is about what you think might happen in the future based on history</li>
                <li>This could be predicting market trends for what to order in a store, or stock for a holiday</li>
                <li>Might be used to try and guess what's going to happen next such as what stock we should have in a store next month</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How we use data every day</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Businesses use data every day to make choices on everything from what to stock, and what to order and what they might need to pre-order way in advance</li>
                <li>Humans use data as well for our choices</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your kids eat grilled cheese twice a week you know how much bread you might need</li>
                        <li>If in previous holiday seasons you spent $200 on presents, you know how much to save for this holiday</li>
                    </ul>

            </ul>

Answer Key
1. Data privacy is important because the vast amount of data collected can paint an incredibly detailed and personal picture of an individual, including habits, health questions, and political views. The companies that profit from this data are not inherently motivated to protect it, making legal safeguards crucial for individual empowerment and control over personal information.
2. The US data privacy framework is described as a "patchwork system" because it lacks a single, comprehensive federal law like the EU's GDPR. Instead, it consists of specific federal laws targeting certain sectors (like HIPAA for healthcare) and a variety of state-level laws, such as the CCPA in California, which creates a fragmented and inconsistent regulatory landscape.
3. "Purpose limitation" is one of GDPR's seven core principles, which mandates that companies must be clear upfront about why they are collecting personal data. They must then stick to using that data only for the specific, stated reason, preventing them from collecting vast amounts of data to figure out a use for it later.
4. One reason for the lack of strong data privacy laws is that technology moves so fast that legislation struggles to keep up with the changes. A second reason is ideological, where some governments prioritize economic growth and capitalism over consumer protection, viewing strict data rules as a hindrance to business.
5. HIPAA's protections are limited to "covered entities" like hospitals, doctors, and insurers, so it does not cover health-related information generated elsewhere. For example, data from fitness trackers, mood apps, late-night symptom searches on Google, or location data showing a visit to a clinic is not protected by HIPAA.
6. GDPR changed enforcement by clearly specifying the penalties for non-compliance, which many previous laws failed to do. The regulation also designated who was responsible for enforcement and designed the fines to be flexible, scalable, and costly enough to be a genuine incentive for companies to follow the law.
7. The "extra-territorial reach" of GDPR means its rules apply to any business, anywhere in the world, that processes data about people located in the EU, regardless of where the business itself is based. This forced companies globally to take notice and change their data handling practices if they wanted to continue doing business with Europe.
8. In 2023, Meta was fined €1.2 billion by Ireland for transferring European user data to the US without adequate privacy protections from the US government. The penalty also included a six-month suspension of these data transfers, directly threatening the company's core operations.
9. "Consumer apathy" refers to the challenge that not enough people care about or understand the importance of data privacy, or they feel overwhelmed and powerless. This lack of sustained public concern makes it politically harder to pass strong consumer protection laws, especially in places like the US where corporate lobbying is influential.
10. Canada has PIPEDA for federal and some business use and has been trying to pass a new law, the CPPA, to expand protections. China has implemented the PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law), which is a comprehensive law closer in style to GDPR than its older, more specific cybersecurity laws.

Essay Questions
Instructions: The following questions are designed for longer, essay-format responses. Use the information and concepts from the source material to construct a thorough and well-supported argument for each prompt.
1. Analyze the tension between individual responsibility, government action, and corporate behavior in ensuring data privacy. Using the provided text, discuss how much can realistically be expected from each party in the face of rapidly changing technology.
2. The source material describes GDPR as a "landmark moment" that appears to be setting a "global standard." Evaluate this claim by discussing GDPR's core principles, its enforcement mechanisms, and its influence on the data privacy legislation of other nations mentioned in the text.
3. Discuss the primary challenges that prevent the creation of comprehensive and up-to-date data privacy laws. Consider the roles of technological speed, competing ideologies (capitalism vs. consumer protection), lobbying, and consumer apathy as described in the sources.
4. Using the example of health data, explain how disparate, unregulated data points can be aggregated to create an "incredibly valuable" and sensitive profile of an individual. How does this reality expose the limitations of sector-specific laws like HIPAA?
5. Compare and contrast the fundamental approaches to data privacy regulation in the European Union and the United States. What do their respective models—the comprehensive, proactive GDPR versus the fragmented, patchwork system—reveal about their underlying governmental structures and societal priorities?

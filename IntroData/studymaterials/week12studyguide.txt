Answer Key
1. The CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality is about keeping data secret and ensuring only authorized individuals have access. Integrity means ensuring the data is accurate, complete, and has not been tampered with. Availability ensures that the data is accessible and usable when it is needed.
2. Data security is about the how—the technical measures and procedures used to protect data from unauthorized access, such as encryption and firewalls. Data privacy is about the who—who has control over the data, who can see it, and an individual's rights over their personal information. You cannot have data privacy without data security, as security measures are what enable privacy.
3. Companies may be reluctant to invest in data security primarily due to cost, as proper implementation of hardware, software, and expertise is expensive and viewed as an expense rather than a direct investment. Additionally, strong privacy and security rules can limit a company's ability to use or sell the large amounts of data they collect, thereby reducing a potential source of income.
4. One major failure was the CEO of Lifelock, an identity protection company, who put his actual social security number on billboards to prove his service's effectiveness. The result was that his identity was stolen 13 times in one year, demonstrating a catastrophic failure in personal data security from the head of a security company. Another example is LogicMonitor, a security company whose customers were breached because LogicMonitor itself used a simple, default password ("Welcome@123") for an admin account with full system access.
5. Good cyber hygiene includes using strong, unique passwords (preferably with a password manager), keeping software updated to patch security holes, and using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible. It also involves being cautious about clicking links, visiting unfamiliar websites, and not oversharing personal information.
6. Large corporations are more profitable targets with more complex systems, but they also have massive resources to invest in security and can often survive the public relations and financial impact of a breach. Small businesses may be less attractive targets, but a breach can be fatal, destroying customer trust in a local community and potentially wiping out their finances, as they lack the resources for top-tier security and recovery.
7. One of the biggest threats is "user apathy," where individuals do not understand or care about the risks of sharing personal data, often conditioned by systems designed to collect information. Another major threat is poor credential management within companies, which includes shared logins, weak or default passwords that are never changed, and unsecured machines. Social engineering, which tricks people into giving up access, is also a persistent threat.
8. Backups are fundamental to the "Availability" principle of the CIA triad, serving as a lifeline to restore data and operations if the primary data is lost, corrupted, or held by ransomware. Two key best practices are to provide backups with the same level of security protection as the original data and to regularly test and verify the backups to ensure they are working correctly before they are needed.
9. "Deleting" a file typically only removes the pointer that directs the operating system to the file's location and marks the space as available for future use; the actual data remains on the hard drive. To truly get rid of data, one must perform a "wipe" by actively overwriting the physical space where the data was stored with random data, a process that may need to be repeated multiple times to obscure the "echo" of the original data.
10. Government sites, identifiable by the .gov top-level domain (such as CISA and NIST), are good starting points as they are not trying to sell a product. Non-profits (.org), like the EFF, are also recommended as they are likely to be less biased. Other reputable sources include research papers from academic journals, vetted presentations from well-known conferences like RSA and Black Hat, and "white papers" from companies (though one should be wary of their potential sales agenda).

Essay Questions
Instructions: Consider the following prompts and prepare a detailed essay-format response for each, synthesizing information from the source material to support your arguments.
1. Discuss the symbiotic yet distinct relationship between Data Security and Data Privacy. Using concepts from the source text, explain why "you can't have data privacy without security" and provide hypothetical scenarios to illustrate this principle.
2. Analyze the corporate perspective on data security. Elaborate on the economic, operational, and philosophical reasons why a business might underinvest in security measures, weighing the perceived costs against the potential risks of a data breach.
3. Compare and contrast the data security threats, vulnerabilities, and potential business impacts for a large, global entity like Facebook and a small, local company. Discuss how scale, resources, and community reputation shape their respective security postures and outcomes after a breach.
4. Explain the full lifecycle of digital data erasure as described in the sources. Detail the technical differences between "delete," "erase," "wipe," and "shred," and discuss the critical implications of these differences for an individual selling a used computer versus a corporation decommissioning a server with sensitive information.
5. The sources state that data security threats come from outside, inside, and from ourselves. Construct an argument that user-related issues, such as apathy and poor cyber hygiene, represent as significant a threat to data security as malicious external hackers.

Glossary of Key Terms
Term
Definition
Availability
A core principle of the CIA triad, ensuring that data is accessible and usable when it is needed. It is protected by measures like backups.
Backups
Copies of data kept to ensure it can be restored if the original is lost or damaged. Backups need the same protection as original data and must be verified.
CIA Principles
The foundation of data security, consisting of Confidentiality (keeping data secret), Integrity (ensuring data is accurate), and Availability (ensuring data is accessible).
Confidentiality
A core principle of the CIA triad, focused on keeping data secret and restricting access to authorized individuals only.
Cyber Hygiene
Basic best practices for individuals and companies to maintain security, such as using strong passwords, keeping software updated, using MFA, and being cautious online.
Cybersecurity
The practice of protecting digital systems and data. It is deeply entwined with data security as most data is now digital and connected to the internet.
Data Privacy
Concerns who has control over data and an individual's rights regarding their personal information, such as who can see it, use it, or delete it ("right to be forgotten").
Data Security
The practice of protecting data from unauthorized access, use, or sharing, regardless of where it is stored or how it is used. It is based on the CIA principles.
Dark Patterns
Design features on websites or in apps that trick users into doing things they might not have intended, such as buying something or signing up for services, often fueled by user data.
Delete
The common user action of removing a file. In most operating systems, this merely removes the pointer to the file's location, leaving the actual data on the drive.
EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation)
A non-profit organization (.org) cited as a reputable source for less-biased information on data security and privacy.
Encryption
A technical method of protecting data, often cited as a core component of data security. It makes data unreadable to unauthorized parties.
Erase
A term often used interchangeably with "delete." It refers to the act of making a file appear gone to the user, though the data often remains and is recoverable.
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
A set of laws and regulations in Europe that require companies to protect user data and can levy heavy fines for non-compliance.
Integrity
A core principle of the CIA triad, meaning that data is accurate, complete, and has not been tampered with or corrupted.
IoT (Internet of Things)
A network of physical devices, such as smart cameras, doorbells, and baby monitors, that are connected to the internet. These devices can pose security risks if not properly secured.
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
A security practice that requires more than one method of verification to grant access (e.g., a password plus a code sent to a phone). Also referred to as 2FA.
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
A U.S. government agency (.gov) that provides frameworks and standards for cybersecurity best practices, serving as a reputable, non-commercial source of information.
Shred
A highly secure method of data destruction that uses specialized software to perform multiple, complex overwrites on a file's physical storage space to make it unrecoverable.
Social Engineering
The practice of tricking people into giving up confidential information or providing access to systems.
User Apathy
A significant threat to data security where users do not care about or understand the risks of sharing their personal data, making them more vulnerable to collection and exploitation.
Wipe
The process of securely erasing data by actively overwriting the physical location on a storage drive where the data existed, making recovery difficult or impossible.

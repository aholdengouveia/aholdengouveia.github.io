            <ul>
                <li>Data integrity can be the accuracy of the data, or making sure that the data you have stored is correct.</li>
                <li>Integrity can also be the completeness of the data, or making sure that if you are storing information, you are storing all the information</li>
                <li>Data integrity can also refer to the method of data storage, or making sure that wherever you have the data such as a hard drive, is working properly</li>
                <li>Data integrity can also be guidelines for data retention, or how long you keep dataData integrity can also be guidelines for data retention, or how long you keep data</li>

        <li>Examples of how to collect data well</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231009033457/https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-collection-methods">Data collection methods in business</a></li>
                <li>Make sure you have a clear plan that everyone who is collecting data can see, including identifying what you need and how it's being measured in clear and hard to misinterpret language</li>
                <li>Decide if you are collecting qualitative (Open ended response such as "I feel good today") or quantitative(numbers such as year you were born) data</li>
                <li>Have a clear system! Include procedures and tests of the people doing the collecting BEFORE sending them out</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How and why to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230301045356/https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-scrubbing">clean data</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Data cleaning is fixing data, removing duplicate data, fixing incorrect data and fixing formatting</li>
                <li>Data cleaning usually removes the data that doesn't belong (Important note!  Keep copy of ORIGINAL data, just in case)</li>
                <li>Quality and validity matters, make sure your data makes sense</li>
                <li>We clean data so that when we work with it later, we get better results.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, we might see both N/A and "non applicable" but they mean the same, so we could group them together</li>
                        <li>This can include outliers, but be warned!  Outlier isn't the same as incorrect, and your definition of "outlier" might not match someone else's, don't ruin your data for a goal or personal opinion</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Examples of how data is cleaned</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We might clean data by only looking at specific age ranges, or locations, as part of the process to make sure we're looking at the right group of people</li>
                <li>We might clean data by removing duplicates such as making sure everyone only did the survey once</li>
                <li>We might clean data by fixing typos, naming conventions, or even just making sure the format is the same for all collected data</li>
                <li>We might clean data by checking validity such as does this data make sense? We asked for a name and got a date, or we asked for a birthday and got a colour</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How AI is used to clean data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence is being used to clean data more and more</li>
                <li>We can use programs to clean data, either the program we used to collect the data, or write out own program to look for specific things.</li>
                <li>New advances in technology is having AI do this for us automatically! Not always correctly, but automatically! Such as AWS sagemaker or AI validator for Google Sheets</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Why data is important to every job</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Good data can lead to better choices, bad data isn't helpful</li>
                <li>All businesses run on data to some extent, even if it's just sales and goods.</li>
                <li>Some businesses run on data more such as social media and more tech focused companies</li>
                <li>Data can help make business more efficient, improve quality, and either make more money or help more people depending on the type of company</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Examples of how data is used in jobs well</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Predicting future sales and stocking of goods</li>
                <li>Predicating market trends so that the right amount of goods can be produced or ordered on time</li>
                <li>Healthcare uses data to see failures in the system and fix them to help save more people</li>
                <li>Data can be used to see trends and either continue or correct them</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Examples of how data is used in jobs poorly</li>
            <ul>

                <li>Laying off people because the data says they don't make money, except those were the people making and checking the good produced so the company can't make money in 6 months</li>

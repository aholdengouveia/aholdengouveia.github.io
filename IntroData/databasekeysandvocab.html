    <ul>
        <li>Normalization</li>
        <ul>
            <li>What is Normalization</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data formatted the same</li>
                    <li>Organizing the data</li>
                    <li>Think of functionality not attractiveness of data</li>
                    <li>Also can be the process of creating the relationship between tables</li>
                    <li>It's the process of creating or fixing the rules about the database to ensure they are being followed</li>
                    <li>Will likely take your data and create multiple tables to organize it</li>
                    <li>Normalization may also reference "Normal Forms" to indicate how well the database has been normalized (note: anything beyond 4NF is unlikely outside academia)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231127094938/https://www.databasestar.com/database-normalization/">Step by step process with examples</a></li>
                </ul>
            <li>Why normalization is important</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Database will be more efficient including queries that are run</li>
                    <li>Makes it easier to reduce duplicate and incorrectly entered information</li>
                    <li>Makes the database smaller because it helps data to be in one place only</li>
                    <li>Makes sure the data is updated everywhere it needs to be</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Normalization Levels Example</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To get to 1NF: single value per field</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: Library book with 2 authors, you can't have both in the author field, so you'd need another deal with the second author in another way because you can't have more than 1 value in the field</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>To get to 2NF, you must have already completed 1NF, remove duplicate data and also setup a candidate  key</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: If the data with the library books includes location of the book we would split out the location key to another table to ensure it's consistent</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">Wikipedia actually has a nice article and table for illustrating this!</a></li>
                </ul>
            <li>Example: Authors</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Book authors :</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>JRR Tolkien</li>
                            <li>J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
                            <li>JRRTolkein</li>
                            <li>Tolkien, JRR</li>
                            <li>Tolkien, J.R.R.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Pennames?</li>
                    <li>Multiple Authors?</li>
                    <li>How can we split the data about books out to be normalized?</li>
                    <li>What other data besides Author do you think could get split out?</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231004072344/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5547/primary-key">Primary Keys</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifier</li>
                <li>Used to be Numeric only</li>
                <li>Unique</li>
                <li>NOT data (i.e not social security numbers)</li>
                <li>Microsoft refers to primary keys as ID</li>
                <li>Modern trend has been to make Primary keys guid instead of numeric to make parallelism easier</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example of a guid: e2bd848b-3472-49ab-8836-9ff21aaf8c56</li>
                            <li>Used to make sure if multiple systems are entering in data they don't use the same key</li>
                            <li>Won't create chokepoint the way incremental key generation might</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230605103131/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7272/foreign-key">Foreign keys</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Also called functionally dependent keys</li>
                <li>Abbreviated FD</li>
                <li>Point to table with the data</li>
                <li>Always point to a primary key</li>
                <li>In other words is a way to link data between tables in your database</li>
                <li>Some databases call both foreign key AND primary key the ID (<--BADBAD)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Example:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>One table with books, that has author name</li>
                <li>Normalize that table to make it easier to use (take one column and split into its own table)</li>
                <li>Also helps data integrity because then you have author name in one place that is called to rather than authors everywhere with different layouts</li>
                <li>Two tables, one with the books, one with the authors</li>
                <li>The way to connect them together is the book table has a foreign key to the author table primary key</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240118203819/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/entity-in-dbms/">Entity</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each table needs the data for one entity</li>
                <li>Every entity has attributes (each book has information saved about it such as Authors and Titles)</li>
                <li>Each table needs the data for one entity (such as authors or Genres)</li>
                <li>Basic way to split up the data</li>
                <li>Example: Entity is a book, attributes are author, publisher and title</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Entity relationship table</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows how entities are connected by the foreign key to primary key link</li>
                <li>Diagram of the stuff in the database</li>
                <li>If you say book is connected to the author, you're giving a map of the database</li>
                <li>ER Diagram is the first thing we look at to see the data we have and how it's connected</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ER is Entity Relationship</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Abstract map of the database</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What data you have</li>
                        <li>What tables you have</li>
                        <li>How they are linked together</li>
                    </ul>

\section*{Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Teach specific and interesting relating to Data, information, Data Science, and Databases, that hasn't been covered and practice your presentation skills.
\end{enumerate}

Pretend you have been given the assignment to give a presentation for peers at a company. Select one of the listed topics and prepare a short lesson(9-11 minutes) which you will present to the class through recorded video on the discussion. The lesson should include why the topic is an important part of the training for data science, any procedures or tools they should know about, and some resources for where people could go to learn more.  This needs to be an extension of what we covered in class or a new topic.  You may NOT just rehash a lesson from term.  NO videos in your presentation(i.e no recording someone else speaking for 10min and playing that as your presentation.  Video must be YOU presenting. You don't need to show your face, but no AI may be used)! Your topic and presentation must center around data science. 

None of these topics should be treated as invitations to be rude to anyone.  All topics should be covered in a non-biased manner.  Focus on the data and data science, not your point of view on the topic.  Even Politics!
Turn in your PowerPoint, video and a report including your sources, you need at least 5, and a CRAP reliability checklist/paragraph for each source. Presentations derived from disreputable sources will not receive credit.  You should use the same CRAP/CRAAP checklists you've been using in your labs.

You may NOT pick the same topic as another student. Whoever claims the topic first gets it.

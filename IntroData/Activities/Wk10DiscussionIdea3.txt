Misleading with "True" Data
Data can be framed to show anything you want it to. For example, "100% of Super Bowls are won by US teams," which is a statistically true fact but is completely misleading because it omits the crucial context that it's an American league.
• Initial Post: Create your own example of a "technically true but misleading" statement. It can be about any topic (sports, academics, entertainment, products). Present your single, misleading sentence just as the source does.
• Interaction Requirement: Reply to a classmate's post. Your job is to be the critical thinker who spots the manipulation. Explain the missing context that reveals why their "true" statement is misleading. What information was strategically left out to frame the narrative in a certain way?

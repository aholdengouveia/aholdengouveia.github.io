Learning Outcome:  Students will be able to apply the concept of using data for the common good by proposing a data-driven solution to a real-world problem and then using UI/UX principles to analyse the critical design challenges in presenting that data to the public
The sources show that collecting and sharing data has driven huge positive changes for humanity, such as proving the importance of handwashing in medicine and the dangers of smoking. This was achieved by using data to change public perception and behaviour.
Initial discussion posting :

    Choose a current societal problem where you believe better data collection and presentation could lead to positive change ( (Such as, food waste or local voter turnout, pick something you're interested in changing). Briefly explain what kind of data would need to be collected and shared to help address the problem.  Be specific in what data you think should be collected.  Have at least 3 specific pieces of data that would be helpful for your topic. 
    Include at least 1 article on the topic in modern life.  In your discussion posting you should link your article, give a quick (5 sentences or less) summary, and include your CRAAP checklist answers.   https://www.aholdengouveia.name/Howtos/sourceEvaluation.html 



Reply to at least 1 classmate:
Drawing on the lessons about UI/UX from our sources, identify one major design challenge they would face in presenting this data to the general public. For example, would the biggest challenge be making the data accessible to people with disabilities, building trust with a sceptical audience, or making a complex issue easy to understand on a mobile phone screen?

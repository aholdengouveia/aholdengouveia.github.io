Identifying Dark Patterns in the Wild
The sources describe "dark patterns" as design choices in interfaces that are specifically meant to trick, coerce, or manipulate you into doing things you wouldn't normally do, like signing up for a recurring bill or finding it impossible to unsubscribe.
• Initial Post: Find and share an example of what you believe is a dark pattern. This could be from an e-commerce site, a social media app, or a subscription service. Identify which specific type of dark pattern it is, using the terminology from the sources (e.g., "Roach Motel" - easy to get in, hard to get out; or "Confirm Shaming" - guilting you into opting in). Explain how the design manipulates the user's choice.
• Interaction Requirement: Reply to a classmate's post. Propose a specific redesign of the interface element your classmate identified that would make it more ethical and transparent. How would you change the wording, the button placement, or the overall process to give the user a fair and clear choice?

USA's Patchwork Problem: One Federal Law or 50 State Laws?
The sources describe the US approach to data privacy as a "dumpster fire" with a mix of federal and state laws that makes it "really hard for companies to deal with". While the EU banded together for one comprehensive law (GDPR), the US has a debate between creating a single federal law or letting each state decide for itself.
• Initial Post: Based on the information in the sources, argue for one side of the debate: Should the US adopt a single, comprehensive federal data privacy law modeled after GDPR, or should each state be free to create its own laws (like California's strict CCPA)? Provide at least one reason from the sources to support your argument (e.g., consistency for businesses, states being "stuck in committee", or states' rights to offer more or less consumer protection).
• Interaction Requirement: Find a classmate who argued for the opposite position. In your reply, play devil's advocate and present the strongest counter-argument to their point. For example, if they argued for a federal law, you could point out that a single law might be slow to pass and weaker than what a proactive state could create on its own

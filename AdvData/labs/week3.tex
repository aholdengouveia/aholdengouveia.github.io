\section*{Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learn about table joins and table relationships
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Complete the following problems}

References, a video, a PowerPoint and some notes are available at my website
\url {https://www.aholdengouveia.name/AdvData/IntroData.html/AdvData/sqlpt2.html}

The tutorial you'll be using is at \url{https://sqlbolt.com/}
The challenges are at \url{https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=join&filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=advanced-join}

Both are free, but HackerRank needs you to register so you'll have a profile to save your work.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item From\url{https://sqlbolt.com/} go through the sections on Table joins and nulls, Sections 6-8. Take screenshots of each challenge at the end after you complete it, making sure each problem has a green checkmark. 
        \item From \url{https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=join&filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=advanced-join} You'll be doing 5 challenges that include table joins.  You can sort by simple and more advanced joins. Take screenshots of each solution making sure to include your name and the term in each screenshot.
        \item Each screenshot from both websites should include a short explanation of how you solved it, and what resources you used.  If you needed hints, include that and where you found the hint. 
        \item Screenshot of your HackerRank profile that includes the completed challenges. 
    \end{enumerate}



\section*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Document that includes each screenshot with explanations.

\section*{Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learn about NoSQL and try a NoSQL database
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Complete the following}

\subsection*{Try out some NoSQL}

Go to \url{https://learn.mongodb.com/} and pick a course to try.  They should be free.  If they are not free, please talk to me, don't pay money for this.  If you're not sure what to try, just try the beginner one "Introduction to MongoDB".  You don't have to do each section, but you should make sure you're comfortable with the topic.  The course can be very long, but make sure you go through at least "MongoDB CRUD Operations: Replace and Delete Documents"


    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If you picked your own, what did you pick and why?
        \item What did you think of the course? Was it hard? Easy? Time consuming? 
        \item How much of the course did you do?
        \item Would you try more? If yes, which ones were interesting to you?
        \item If you register you can try out the concepts for free.  Which concepts did you try?
        \item Did you complete enough to earn a certificate of completion? If not, you may want to consider it, you can put those on your resume.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{NoSQL Scalability}
    Answer the following questions about NoSQL scalability, pick a data set that clearly requires NoSQL. 
   
   \begin{itemize}
     \item What data set did you pick? Where is it from? Include a URL
     \item Why does the data set require NoSQL? Why could you not use SQL?
     \item Evaluate at least 2 specific vendors for a database for your data set.
     \item What are 3 examples of real time analytics that your data set might be used for?  Be specific.
   \end{itemize}

\section*{Deliverables}
A text document with the answers to the above questions. Make sure to clearly label both the questions and which section they are from so it's easy to see which thing you're answering.

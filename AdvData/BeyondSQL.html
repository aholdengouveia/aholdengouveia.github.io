            <ul>
                <li>Pros</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very popular for a long time so there is a decent amount of documentation and some standards</li>
                        <li>Relatively simple for people who aren't programmers to learn</li>
                        <li>There are some built in security and data integrity features</li>
                        <li>It's possible to see data in different views  so you can have more abstraction and can limit user access/viewing when needed</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Cons</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limits on what it can be used for since it requires structured data<li>
                        <li>There can be hidden rules which make it harder to control fully</li>
                        <li>No real time analytics, so things that want real time data processing is an issue</li>
                        <li>Large datasets can lead to longer processing times because of the way queries perform</li>
                        <li>Setup of SQL databases can be complicated and need specific skill sets</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Beyond SQL</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>NoSQL is non-relational database model, literally non-SQL or not only SQL</li>
            <li>NoSQL is useful for larger datasets and real time analytics and data processing especially</li>
            <li>There are a lot of different ways you can organize NoSQL type databases, one is by data model</li>
            <li>For reference, SQL stores data in tables, NoSQL can store data in many other models including objects, documents and graphs</li>
            <li>Because the data is not done in a way that shows relationships, schema are designed differently</li>
            <li>NoSQL tends to not use joins in the queries because the data isn't stored in tables, NoSQL uses multiple queries  instead</li>
            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240903230214/https://www.christof-strauch.de/nosqldbs.pdf">NoSQL Databases</a> NOTE: Very long paper, but has some really good examples and explanations</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240520040135/https://www.adservio.fr/post/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-nosql">Pros and Cons of NoSQL</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Pros</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scalability for larger datasets</li>
                    <li>Can store data outside the traditional SQL options</li>
                    <li>Real time analytics is possible</li>
                    <li>Less maintenance needed in general</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cons</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hasn't been popular as long so there has been less stress testing then SQL</li>
                    <li>Less complex queries are done so usually multiple queries are used instead of table joins</li>
                    <li>Additional infrastructure may be needed for scaling</li>
                    <li>Difficult to change data once added</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240616144216/https://www.integrate.io/blog/the-sql-vs-nosql-difference/">SQL vs NoSQL</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>SQL</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relational</li>
                    <li>Schema is predesigned</li>
                    <li>Vertically scalable - more power added to scale database, such as upgrading current servers</li>
                    <li>Based on tables</li>
                    <li>Needs structured data</li>
                </ul>
            <li>NoSQL</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Non-relational</li>
                    <li>Schema can be dynamic to accommodate unstructured data</li>
                    <li>Horizontally scalable - more nodes are added to scale database, such as adding more servers</li>
                    <li>Uses other data structures besides tables</li>
                    <li>Can work with unstructured and semi-structured data</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240407020057/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-nosql-databases/">Types of NoSQL</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>There are multiple ways to classify NoSQL databases, some of which can overlap</li>
            <li>One common way to classify the types is by data structure, or the way in which the data is stored</li>
            <li>Some common types are graph, key-value and document</li>
            <li>The vocab that is used for the way the data is stored can be different than expected, especially if you're coming from programming</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240901120421/https://www.influxdata.com/key-value-database/">NoSQL Example: Key Value Store</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>This uses a data structure that is an associative array or dictionary if you're coming from programming</li>
            <li>This type will use key-value pairs, each piece of data has an associated key</li>
            <li>The unique key is how you can retrieve your data from the database, the data can be simple (string) or complex (object)</li>
            <li>One way to think of this is like a relational database but it only has two columns in the table, the key and the value</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240926115325/https://redis.io/nosql/document-databases/">NoSQL Example: Document Store</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of using tables with rows and columns, there is a document to store the data</li>
            <li>Documents may be closer to the data objects so there may be less modifications needed to retrieve the data</li>
            <li>Collections are a group of documents with similar contents, you can also use things like tags or metadata to organize and group the data</li>
            <li>Flexible schema is used, the documents don't need to all have the same schema</li>
            <li>Document creation is easy, not much maintenance is required</li>
            <li>No foreign keys are needed because there is no relationship between documents required</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241008121539/https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/graph/">NoSQL Example: Graph Databases</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Best for data that has relationships that need a graph to represent them, such as networking topologies or social connections</li>
            <li>The focus Is on the relationship been the elements.  The nodes on a graph can be connected by links</li>
            <li>Query can have real time results for output</li>
            <li>How fast results show depend on the number of connections or relationships</li>
            <li>Adding data is easy by adding new nodes or edges, schema doesn't need to be changed much</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

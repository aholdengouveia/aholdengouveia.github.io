        <li>What is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240426135006/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/database-schemas/">database schema</a>?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In relational databases we need to organize the data</li>
                <li>When data is organized we need a map or blueprint of it so we know how everything is put together</li>
                <li>Schema can also be the rules or formulas for how the database is done</li>
                <li>Schemas will create these rules to ensure data integrity is maintained</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240302134424/https://www.integrate.io/blog/database-schema-examples/#one">Why is this important?</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Having a map or blueprint allows us to see at a glance the relationships of our database</li>
            <li>Having rules for our database helps our data integrity, which is an important component to databases</li>
            <li>Data is often "dirty" and that affects how it's used and the accuracy of results</li>
            <li>A schema is also a good way to share this information in a concise way with others</li>
            <li>A perfect database you can never share or have others use wouldn't be useful</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What's included?</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Database Schemas are likely to have</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tables with labeled fields</li>
                    <li>Primary key and foreign keys with relationships illustrated</li>
                    <li>Any rules or requirements for adding data</li>
                    <li>Notes on if particular data types are required</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Schemas tend to include pictures and graphical representations to illustrate all of this</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Advantages of having schema</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Design Consistency - records of how the database was put together are useful for you and anyone that has to interact with it</li>
            <li>Scalability - Well organized data and databases are easier to grow then if they were not well put together</li>
            <li>Optimization - Knowing how the database is organized can help queries run faster</li>
            <li>Maintenance -  It's easier to fix and maintain a well-organized well documented database</li>
            <li>Security - Having a plan of how you're storing and protecting your sensitive data means it's more likely to be followed by everyone</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Types of schema</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical schema</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explains how the data is stored on the actual storage</li>
                    <li>Usually will have the explanation including files and indices</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Logical schema</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Includes the relationships of the tables</li>
                    <li>The rules that the data has to follow is included here</li>
                    <li>Will include the ER modelling</li>
                </ul>
                <li>View schema</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>How the end user will work with the database</li>
                    <li>To see this you don't need all the other information, so it might be easier for some people to follow</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240516010045/https://www.integrate.io/blog/complete-guide-to-database-schema-design-guide/">Schema design<a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>There are a lot of potential design options for schema</li>
            <li>They are chosen based on what makes the most sense for the data and application</li>
        </ul>
            <li>Examples of database schema design options:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flat model schema</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is basically like a single table</li>
                            <li>Very simple</li>
                            <li>Doesn't model all the data needs for more complex situations</li>
                            <li>Likely only useful if you could do a spreadsheet instead of a database</li>
                            <li>Might be used for a small company with only a few  employees that need an employee database</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Hierarchical model schema</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Looks like a tree structure like you might see in programming data structures</li>
                            <li>Contains a root node where the information is starting from</li>
                            <li>Used for things like nested data because it's the parent/child model</li>
                            <li>An example use case for a school might be a database of employees and students</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Network model schema</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Similar to the hierarchal schema</li>
                            <li>This allows many-to-many relationships to be illustrated, whereas networking only allows one-to-many</li>
                            <li>Network model schema means you can include workflows and paths to the data</li>
                            <li>Example use case might be a restaurant  chain where you need to keep track of inventory and employees but you also want to model workflows for cash and food delivery</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Relational model schema</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mostly used in relational databases</li>
                            <li>Used to keep track of the table and relationships</li>
                            <li>Some say it's better for object-oriented design</li>
                            <li>Example use case in a school we have classes, faculty and students, departments and divisions, or other data that is related</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Star model schema</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can be used for larger amounts of data</li>
                            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240914002743/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/star-schema-in-data-warehouse-modeling/">Used frequently for data marts and data warehouses</a></li>
                            <li>Has the general appearance of a star, where there is a central table called the fact table, and connected to that are the dimension tables that describe other important info</li>
                            <li>The relationships are described using foreign key relationships</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Snowflake model schema</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Snowflake is an adaptation of the star schema</li>
                            <li>Like the star style, there is a central table that stores datapoints and references to dimensional tables</li>
                            <li>However it expands on star by allowing multiple dimensional tables to include even more information</li>
                            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230330143349/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snowflake-schema-in-data-warehouse-model/">Also used frequently for data marts and data warehouses</a></li>
                            <li>Same example as star model, but used when more data is needed, such as  breaking out a location table for customers, or departments for employees</li>
                        </ul>

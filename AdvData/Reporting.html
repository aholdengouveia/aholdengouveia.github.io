        <li>What are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240424070705/https://www.devx.com/terms/database-report/">Database Reports</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>A database report is a way to see important info from the database</li>
                <li>Reports can be done by hand or done automatically by the software that is running the database, or a combo of both</li>
                <li>Reports can be done at assigned times or by a predetermined condition, and run by the software, or done by hand</li>
                <li>Reports can be used for everything from sales data, to details about users, to totally customized drilled down data depending on what's needed</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240916070404/https://www.sigmacomputing.com/resources/learn/guide-to-dashboards">dashboard</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>A dash board is a way to show information visually, it's made up of widgets</li>
            <li>Widgets are a way to show small pieces of the data that are really important performance or metrics</li>
            <li>You can have multiple dashboards for different audiences, for example, one for system metrics such as does the database have enough free space and memory that a DBA would want to care about.  But then you can have another dashboard for users that would care about different things such as books checked out, or inventory levels</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Why we use reports and dashboards</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>We use reports for everything from presentations to C-suite people to compliance requirements</li>
            <li>Reports are usually static pieces of information that are true for that moment in time</li>
            <li>Dashboards are made of widgets, usually updated on a reliable time frame such as hourly, daily or weekly</li>
            <li>Dashboards are good ways to keep track of things to see problems immediately and fix them, reports are good for seeing what happened or seeing where the system is at one point</li>
            <li>Both will take metrics and performance and present them in different ways</li>
            <li>Both take the data and present it in a structured coherent way so you can make informed decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241002181126/https://amplitude.com/blog/product-north-star-metric">North Star Metric</a></li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on the important information, don't clutter the visualization</li>
            <li>Being able to identify ways to get rid of things on a dashboard is valuable, you don't want to have more information or the wrong information getting in the way</li>
            <li>North Star Metric is a way to focus on the most important value without getting led astray</li>
            <li>The North Star is your key measure for success, it's used commonly for product -led companies</li>
            <li>Picking your North Star Metric is aligned with your customer values and product (also known as how the company says they are making the most money)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Example: Good report and Dashboard</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Good Reports</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear purpose</li>
                        <li>Focused on the key metrics</li>
                        <li>Uses data visualizations to communicate important take aways from the data</li>
                        <li>Data is up to date, cleaned, and doesn't contain extraneous information</li>
                        <li>Includes an action item</li>

        <li>Example: Bad reports and Dashboard</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Bad Reports</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Too much clutter</li>
                        <li>Too long</li>
                        <li>Shows raw data without context</li>
                        <li>Shows bad, inconsistent or old data</li>
                </ul>

        </ul>
        <li>Some different ways to have bad Dashboards</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>System metrics that are easy to make into a widget and are actually irrelevant such as I/O on a system that doesn't I/O</li>
            <li>Multiple representations for the same concept, for example looking at both the books checked out and authors checked out, yes we can track both, but do we really care?</li>
            <li>Proxy information instead of actual information, for example memory for book checkouts, yes it goes up with more people checking out books, but why not just look at book checkout numbers</li>
            <li>Simulate a dashboard by running a report frequently and calling live information</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Some example reporting tools</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Open Source options include Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (<a href="https://eclipse-birt.github.io/birt-website/">BIRT</a>) Project, and the ones built into LibreOffice Base</li>
            <li>There are also tools that are sold such as <a href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a href="https://www.zoho.com/analytics/">ZoHo Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi">Power BI</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/">Oracle</a>.  Some will have dashboard options as well as reports since they are both commonly used</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Some example dashboards</li> 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-dataset">Power BI</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/dashboard/dashboard-examples">Tableau</a></li>
            <li>Other examples include: Oracle Analytics Cloud, Domo and AWS QuickSight</li>
        </ul>
        <li>How to pick if you need a dashboard or a report or both</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Dashboards</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You need updating information</li>
                <li>You need to watch over time for key metrics</li>
                <li>You need to see problems before they happen</li>
                <li>You need alerts for key metrics and/or performance</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Reports</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You need to turn in information from a snapshot in time</li>
                <li>You need to turn in a summary for a meeting or compliance requirement</li>
                <li>You need to look at why a problem happened and do a post mortem</li>
                <li>You need static information/data</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Some example use cases</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Report - Giving a presentation or Executive summary of a database to higher ups in a company</li>
            <li>Dashboard - Keep track of the VM running the database to make sure there aren't provisioning issues and no slow downs</li>
            <li>Report - Analyze specific issues that are going on, such as healthcare appointments being scheduled too frequently</li>
            <li>Dashboard - Monitor health of code release</li>
            <li>Report - Compliance, most places that have to follow compliance laws and regulations for their industry are required or strongly encouraged to turn in reports that correspond to the stated findings</li>
            <li>Dashboard - Predicting issues before they happen, such as trying to head off support tickets before customers can complain</li>
        </ul>

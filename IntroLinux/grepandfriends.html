                <li>grep is a command to filter lines that contain specific text</li>
                <li>Examples</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>cat /etc/passwd</li>
                        <li>cat /etc/passwd  | grep Jane</li>
                        <li>cat /etc/passwd |  grep Jane |wc -l</li>
                        <li>cat /etc/passwd | grep -v Jane</li>

            <li>Redirect ></li>
            <li>Append >></li>
            <li>What's the difference? Redirect erases the file contents, append puts the results at the end of the file</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Display file options</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322154324/https://ss64.com/bash/diff.html">diff</a> to compare files</li>
                <li>By default the output is designed to be read by computer not human</li>

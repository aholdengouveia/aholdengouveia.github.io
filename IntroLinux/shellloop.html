    <ul>
        <li>What is a loop</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Loop takes care of repetitive tasks</li>
                <li>Not the same as if/else or case statements</li>
                <li>Use Cases</li> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move or delete files over a certain size/age/attribute</li>
                        <li>Number manipulation (such as increase all numbers by 1)</li>
                        <li>Changing whole folders of files (such as adding time stamps or changing permissions)</li>
                        <li>Searching for a value</li>
                        <li>Check computer status (such as is the server up)</li>
                    </ul>

            </ul>
        <li>While loops</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>While runs as long as condition is successfully executing, stops when condition is false</li>
            <li>Some example use cases might be counting, or reading input</li>
            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240112214245/https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_09_02.html">While loop documentation with example code</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>For loops</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Also called a for-each</li>
            <li>Some example use cases might be if you needed to process a sequence or list of items,or work with items from another command such as cat or ls</li>
            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240112211346/https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_09_01.html">For loop documentation with example code</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Until loops</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Similar to the while loop, but the thing happens until the condition is met</li>
            <li>Some use cases might be if you needed a sequence or specific input</li>
            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240112195053/https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_09_03.html">Until loop documentation with example code</a></li>

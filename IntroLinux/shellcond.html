    <ul>
        <li>Basic If-Then-Else loop</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Conditionals mean you have choices in a path, this is not the same as a loop</li>
                <pre> 
                    if [condition]
                    then
                    echo 
                    yes
                    
                    else
                    echo "no"
                    
                    fi </pre>
                    <li>if [ $answer = “Y” ] Brackets do test (can also use function test)</li>
                    <li>There are some required pieces of syntax such as "then" that are needed for an if statement</li>
                    <li>echo “Yes” If condition is true (can be multiple statements)</li>
                    <li>echo “No” If condition is false (can be multiple statements)</li>
                    <li>fi End of conditional (if backwards) is used to indicate the if statement has ended</li>
                    <li>if statements can also be nested if you wish to have multiple paths, be careful though!  A nested if is NOT the same as two if statements next to each other.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240128013417/https://ioflood.com/blog/bash-if-statement/">if statements in bash in more detail with some examples</a></li>
            </ul>
        <li>Case Statements</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Another kind of conditional.  This is still a way of indicating paths and choices, not loops, but has differnt syntax.</li>
            <li>If statements can be used to evaluate if one thing has happened, or if you include if-then-else two choices, but they can also include multiple choices by using the if-elseif-elseif...-else </li>

        </ul>
        <li>Conditional statement options</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Tests for string comparison use "="</li> <pre> string = string</pre>
            <li>Test for numbers (-eq -le -ge -gt -lt )</li> <pre>14 -eq 14</pre>
            <li>You can also have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240206005354/https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/fto.html">file test operators</a> such as -e and -s</li> <pre>-e /path/path/file</pre>

        </ul>
        <li>Debugging and common mistakes</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Space matters (there and not there, can be picky)</li>
            <li>Make sure the condition is right type (-eq vs = vs -f)</li>
            <li>Watch for closing fi</li>

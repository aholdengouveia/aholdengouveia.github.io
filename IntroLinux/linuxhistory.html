            </ul>
        <li>Common Uses for Linux</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Phones and Tablets (Android is Linux Based) and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide">about 70%</a> of the market as of 2022</li>
                <li>Servers, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system">over 80% of web sites run some version of Linux/Unix</a></li>
                <li>Supercomputers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230110125615/https://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1/">starting in November of 2017</a>, all 500 of the top Supercomputers run some version of Linux</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Advantages and Disadvantages of Linux</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Advantages</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230115085435/https://www.computerworld.com/article/3252823/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html">Why Linux has better Security</a></li>
                        <li>Almost all versions of Linux are Free!</li>
                        <li>Linux can handle less resources so you can use older computers longer, and cheap computers with less power (ex. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>)</li>
                        <li>Everything can be customized!</li>
                        <li><a href="https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major">There are a lot of options to choose from</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Disadvantages</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linux is less popular on Desktop Computers so most people aren't familiar with it, and the learning curve can be rough. </li>
                        <li>Compatibility, because it's not widely adopted, Linux programs aren't common, and most things are made for Windows.</li>
                        <li>There is NO tech support, if you run into an issue it's all on you to solve, hope your GoogleFu is strong.</li>
                        <li>Hardware Compatibility, Device drivers are an issue with Linux, it can be hard to find things that work with your system. If you want a printer you can't just go buy one, you need to find one that's compatible. </li>
                        <li>Everything can be customized!</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Vocabulary</li>    
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/">Man pages</a> (Short for Manual)</li>
                <li><a href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-linux-distribution/">Distros or Flavours</a> are which kind of Linux you're using</li>

<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>Find one person you think is interesting in the open source community and write a quick paragraph to tell us about them.  First come first serve on who you pick.  </li>
        <li>This discussion is about all the variety of Linux flavors that are out there and your thoughts on that. Pick 1 flavor of Linux and tell us about it. Things to think about:
            <ul>
                <li>You know from the materials in this first topic that Linux has more options then any other OS, do you think that's good? Bad? Neither?</li>
                <li>Can you see any problems with having so many options?</li>
                <li>Can you see any benefits to having so many options?</li>
            </ul>
        <li>If using these on an LMS (Learning Management System such as Blackboard or Canvas) consider adding the following: Your person is picked by including their name in the title of your thread after you name.  Duplications are not counted</li>    
    <li>Activity: Listen to <a href="podcasts/Linux_Unveiled__The_Hidden_Powerhouse_Behind_Your_Digital_LifeCIS117wk1.mp4">This Podcast</a> That was created using AI from these materials.  <a href="podcasts/PodcastTranscriptwk01.txt"> Transcript for the Podcast</a> What are your thoughts? Did the AI do a good job representing the materials? Did you find any mistakes?  </li>
    <li>Go through <a href="studyguides/StudyGuidewk01.txt">This AI generated study guide</a>, what do you think? Did it capture the week materials well? How did you do on the self quiz? Do you know all the vocab used? </li>
    <li>Go through <a href="studyguides/briefingdocwk01.txt">This AI generated briefing document</a>, what do you think? Did it capture the week materials well? Was there anything it missed? Do you know all the vocab used? </li>

    <ul>
        <li>What is a script and why do we care?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Small programs that can be used for multiple things including repetitive tasks and repeated activities</li>
                <li>A text file with 1 command per line</li>
                <li>Scripts are also good for Complicated things you don't use often, If you need to figure it out once, why not make a script so you don't have to do it again?</li>
                <li>Comments use a #</li>
                <li>Always start with shbang to specify shell type, it's not required, but it makes it more clear what kind of script you're writing</li>
                <li>An example tutorial for scripting can be found <a href="https://www.shellscript.sh/">here</a> includes some history of scripting and BASH as well</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Types of text in scripts/li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Plain (no quotes) <pre>echo hello</pre></li>
            <li>Semi-opaque (double quotes, expands variables) <pre>echo "hello $name"</pre></li>
            <li>Opaque (single quote, shows exactly what's in quotes)<pre> echo 'hello $name'</pre></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Important things to know</li>

            <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240104183154/https://byby.dev/bash-shebang">Shbang line</a> <pre>#!/bin/sh</pre></li>
            <li>To run, file must be executable (it's not by default so you will need to change the <a href="networking.html">file permissions</a> There is a video example of me showing how to do that <a href="https://youtu.be/7rY9OVA_7VQ?si=_Tn75G6Mhjvy9WHB">here</a>)</li>
            <li>To run you need to use the path of your script (unless in PATH)</li>
            <li>It is important to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231204082603/https://dev.to/flippedcoding/its-important-to-test-your-code-3lid">TEST YOUR CODE</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sequence of a successful script</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Test commands at command prompt</li>
            <li>Create and edit the file in an editor (VIM)</li>
            <li>Start script with shbang line ( such as: #!/bin/bash)</li>
            <li>Add comment with function, name and date</li>
            <li>Save</li>

            <h2>Introduction to Linux</h2>
            <p>This class is designed for someone that has never used Linux before and would like to start.  We go over how to ssh into a server or setup a virtual machine for practice. Starting at the very beginning of what is Linux, who uses it, and then going into some more depth for some basic scripting practice.  The last set of videos are how to use some power tools, Grep, Sed and Awk, but that is more advanced knowledge for if you want to have some ideas on where to go next. </p>

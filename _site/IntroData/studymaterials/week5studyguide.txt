Quiz Answer Key
The primary objective of database normalization is to organize data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It contributes to efficiency by making queries faster and updates more consistent, as data resides in one authoritative place.
"Single value per field" for 1NF means that each field in a table must contain only one indivisible piece of data. For example, a single "Author" field cannot contain "JRR Tolkien, C.S. Lewis"; these would need to be handled separately.
2NF builds on 1NF by requiring that all non-key attributes in a table be fully dependent on the entire primary key, not just a part of it. Its main goal is to remove partial dependencies and further reduce duplicate data.
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record (row) in a table. Two crucial characteristics are that it must be unique for every record and it should not be data itself (e.g., not a social security number).
A GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) is a long, unique alphanumeric string used as a primary key. It's preferred in large, distributed systems because it's practically guaranteed to be unique across multiple systems without coordination, avoiding bottlenecks of incremental keys.
A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes relationships by pointing to the primary key of the related table, linking the data between them.
The "bad practice" is when some database systems use the generic term "ID" for both primary and foreign keys. This is problematic because it creates confusion, making it unclear whether a column is a unique identifier within its own table or a pointer to another table.
An "entity" in database design represents a distinct, real-world object or concept about which data is stored (e.g., a book, an author). "Attributes" are the characteristics or pieces of data that describe an entity (e.g., for a book entity, attributes might be title, author, and publisher).
An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a visual representation that shows the entities (tables) in a database and how they are connected. It serves as an "abstract map" by illustrating the data structure, tables, and their linkages via keys, providing a blueprint of the database.
Normalization contributes to data integrity by ensuring data is stored in one place, which reduces the chance of inconsistencies. It reduces update anomalies because a change to a piece of data only needs to be made once, guaranteeing it's correct everywhere it's referenced.
Essay Questions (No Answers Provided)
Discuss the trade-offs involved in database normalization. While the sources primarily highlight advantages, what potential disadvantages might arise, and in what scenarios might a less normalized database be preferable?
Using the library book example, elaborate on how the progression from 1NF to 2NF addresses specific data integrity and redundancy issues. Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation.
Explain the strategic importance of primary and foreign keys in maintaining the logical structure and integrity of a relational database. How would a database function without these key types?
Imagine you are designing a database for an online streaming service. Describe the entities you would likely include, identify their key attributes, and propose how you would use primary and foreign keys to link these entities, illustrating with a conceptual ER diagram description.
Beyond just reducing redundancy and improving efficiency, discuss how database normalization prepares a database for future adaptability and scalability, especially in evolving business or technological environments.
Glossary of Key Terms
1NF (First Normal Form): The first stage of normalization where each field in a table contains only one atomic (single, indivisible) value.
2NF (Second Normal Form): The second stage of normalization, which requires the database to be in 1NF and all non-key attributes to be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key. It aims to eliminate partial dependencies.
Attributes: The characteristics or properties that describe an entity. In a database, these typically correspond to the columns in a table.
Candidate Key: Any field or combination of fields that could uniquely identify a record in a table. One candidate key is chosen to be the primary key.
Columns: Vertical components of a table that represent a specific attribute or type of data (e.g., "Author Name," "Book Title").
Data Integrity: The accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data over its entire lifecycle. Normalization helps maintain data integrity.
Entity: A distinct, real-world object or concept about which data is stored in a database (e.g., a book, an author, a genre). Each table typically represents one entity.
Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram: A visual representation or abstract map of a database that illustrates how different entities (tables) are related to each other, typically through primary and foreign keys.
Foreign Key (FK): A field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes and enforces a link between the data in two tables. Also called a functionally dependent key (FD).
Functionality (of data): Refers to how well the data structure supports its intended use, such as efficient querying and consistent updates, rather than its aesthetic presentation.
GUID (Globally Unique Identifier): A unique alphanumeric string used as a primary key, especially in distributed systems, guaranteeing uniqueness without coordination across multiple systems.
Normalization: The process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves creating or fixing rules for the database to ensure they are followed.
Normal Forms: Different levels or stages of database normalization (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, 4NF). Each normal form has specific rules for structuring data.
Primary Key (PK): A unique identifier chosen from the candidate keys for each record (row) in a table. It must be unique, stable, and not actual data. Often referred to as "ID" by some systems.
Queries: Requests for data or information from a database. Efficient normalization makes queries faster.
Redundancy: The unnecessary duplication of data within a database, which normalization aims to reduce.
Relation: Another term for a table in a relational database.
Rows: Horizontal components of a table that represent a single record or instance of an entity (e.g., a specific book or author).
Unique Identifier: Any key (like a primary key or GUID) that ensures each record can be distinctly identified within a table or system.

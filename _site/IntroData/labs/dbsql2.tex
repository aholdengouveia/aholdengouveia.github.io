\section*{Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The objective of this lab is to continue working with SQL to learn more advanced topics such as filters and functions. Prior knowledge SQL is assumed. Students will gain a understanding of SQL functions and filters through interactive methods utilizing a free online tutorial and other resources.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Instructions}

References, a video, a PowerPoint and some notes are available at my website
\url {https://www.aholdengouveia.name/IntroData/sql2.html}

The tutorial you will be following is here: \url{https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/more-advanced-sql-queries/pt/more-complex-queries-with-andor} 


\subsection*{Please include answers to the following questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How do you think this compares to the first tutorial from  Kahn Academy?
        \item What do you think is missing from this tutorial? Why? 
        \item Take screenshots of each challenge and the project at the end, include your answer and an explanation of what if anything you found it challenging, (there should be 5 screenshots total), make sure to have a note with your name and the term in the screenshot, screenshot should be focused on the note and answer, not the full desktop.  Any screenshots that don't include the note, or are full desktop, or taken with a camera instead of a screenshot won't count and will earn no points. This is an example of what it should look like:

            \caption{This is an image of what each of your screenshots should look like}

            \end{figure} 
    \end{enumerate}

    \section*{Tutorial Recommendation}
You should find a tutorial that you would recommend to another person that wanted to learn SQL filters and functions.  The tutorial can be interactive or not.  Videos that you can follow along with count as tutorials for this. You should find at least 3 options for tutorials/videos that you also include here. In your recommendation you should explain why you picked the one you did over the other two including pros and cons of each. 

You may not include any of the links I've shared anywhere on Blackboard and my website in your list, they must be new to you materials and tutorials/videos. They must also be different then anything else you've submitted anywhere.  These must be new to you.


\section*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A document containing all requested screenshots
    \item Answers to the above questions
    \item Your tutorial recommendation.  Review should be at least a paragraph but no more then two pages. Make sure they are new options.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The goal of this lab assignment is for students to distinguish between good and bad UI/UX using real-world examples. Through practical examples and observations, students will gain an understanding of how to evaluate UI/UX through a checklist of what to look for.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Answer the following questions}
Each of the above 4 websites above showcases some of the best and the worst of UI/UX. Going through the entries/comments/winners/submissions please answer the following questions using the 10 point checklist and feedback pointers from \url{https://designlab.com/blog/design-critique-checklist-for-ux-designers#ten} If the point isn't relevant to your question, you may include an explanation of why instead. For example, if you want to critique a physical product, it may not have a navigation or mobile design to give feedback on, and it's ok to explain that. 

You should pick 4 specific examples from the above websites.  The 4 examples are going to be your favorite, least favorite, most humorous, and who should have won.  

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What was your favorite design? Evaluate it using the checklist.
        \item What was your least favorite design? Or most aggravating design?Evaluate it using the checklist.
        \item Which of the bad examples did you find most humorous and why? Evaluate it using the checklist.
        \item From the good example submissions, but not winners, who do you think should have won an award, And why? Evaluate it using the checklist.
    \end{enumerate}



\section*{Deliverables}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A text document with answers to each of the above questions, making sure to include the 10 point checklist for EACH of the 4 choices you picked from above.  An example of this is attached to the lab, you can fill this table out for each of your 4 choices.  You may do 4 documents clearly labelled for which one it is, or one document that contains all 4 clearly labelled.
    \item Find an article from the past year on a use of data that you consider bad or unethical, make sure the article is from a reputable source using the CRAAP test, and specific to a company/industry.

<!--Tutorial Link to the original Builder of the project-->    
<div class="container">
    <p>For this project we are going to be using an Open Source project called <a href="https://www.mysqueezebox.com/download">Logitech Media Server</a>, there is a Docker install, Pi install, and Kubernetes option.  The project is open source and privacy forward, so by default everything is done locally so you can control your own data.  You can either stream media such as music or audio books to your tablets/phone/computer you can also stream music to your smart speakers if you have some.  The Github for this project is <a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver">here</a> the code has been released under the GPLv3, so even though this used to be owned by Logitech for their systems, they have released this server as open source for the community and no longer make the Squeezebox server this was based on.

<!--What I thought about as I was working on it-->

<div class="container">
    <p><h3>Logitech Media Server</h3>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <div id="two">Unsure what to pick?  Try the Docker command!  You will need a <a href="/SmartHome/ServerSetup.html">Server</a> with <a href="/SmartHome/Virtualizationsetup.html">Virtualization</a> installed, but the <a href="/SmartHome/Virtualizationsetup.html#Docker">Docker install</a> is pretty straightforward and they have documentation focused on the Docker way to do the install <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/lmscommunity/logitechmediaserver">Here</a>. </div>
    </p>
</div>

<!--Install using Docker-->
<div class="container">
    <p><h3>How to set up Logitech Media Server using Docker </h3>
        <p>
            First we need to login to our server, you can do this on SSH if you want, or by going over to your server and logging in if it has a monitor.  If you need a refresh on how to SSH into a server I made a video for you!  It's <a href="https://youtu.be/w3yOQFZJMTo">here</a>.  Then we can run the given Docker command from <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/odroid">the documentation</a>. You'll need to scroll down to the portion that is for container installs. 
            <div class="container">
                <!--Don't use code tag on multi-line code chunks, makes html mad.-->
                <pre>docker run -it \
                    -v "/PATH":"/config":rw \
                    -v "/PATH":"/music":ro \
                    -v "/PATH":"/playlist":rw \
                    -v "/etc/localtime":"/etc/localtime":ro \
                    -v "/etc/timezone":"/etc/timezone":ro \
                    -p 9000:9000/tcp \
                    -p 9090:9090/tcp \
                    -p 3483:3483/tcp \
                    -p 3483:3483/udp \
                    lmscommunity/logitechmediaserver</pre>

                    <p>NOTE: You should change PATH so that it matches your machine.  Some examples might be /LMSconfig or /LMSplaylist.  Because this is where it saves things like the configuration files, playlists and finds your music, it's important to know where everything is on your machine.  </p>
        </div>
                Now one thing to note, you'll see \ on the lines in the documentation, you don't type those in, those are there to indicate that the command continues even though it's on a new line. One way to handle this is to copy/paste the command into a text file, make your edits, and then copy/paste into your terminal.  That way you don't have to risk typos, or deal with scrolling through a long command on the terminal.
        </p> 
    </p>
</div>

<!--Install using Kubernetes-->
<div class="container">
    <p><h3>How to set up Logitech Media Server using Kubernetes </h3>
        If you haven't already set up your namespace, I recommend you do that first.  I have a sample recipe for that <a href="/SmartHome/namespace.yaml">here</a> that will create a namespace called smart-home, you can reference <a href="/SmartHome/Virtualizationsetup.html#Kubectl">how to use kubectl</a> if you want to refresher on how to set that up.  
        
        Check to make sure your namespace is up by doing 
        <pre>get namespaces</pre> <p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/getnamespace.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="image of making sure namespace was created"></p></li>
    </p>
    <p>
        Next we need to setup our YAML file for Logitech Media Server, a sample is <a href="/SmartHome/LogitechMediaServer.yaml">here</a>, you can use this but you MUST change the location of your path.  I have a comment in there on where to change the YAML, and some notes about how the YAML is put together, but you have to make sure you have a path to where you want your information stored. 
        <div id="two">If you update nothing else in that file, you still HAVE to update the path in BOTH places on the persistent volume areas.  The YAML paths for the volume mounts can stay the same.  But in the persistent volume and persistent volume claim, those paths MUST change to match your server setup.  For example, on my server it would be /media/aholdengouveia/kubernetes/ because I put all my kubernetes data under my username so I can find everything easily. </div>

        <p>
            If you need a reminder on how to use kubectl please go <a href="/SmartHome/Virtualizationsetup.html#Kubectl">check out my kubectl guide here</a> and make sure to run in the correct directory
        </p>

         <ul>
            <li>You should navigate to your kubernetes directory first, making sure to go to the folder that has your YAML files. <pre>cd ~/kubernetes/smarthome</pre></li>
            <li>Edit your Logitech Media Server YAML, you can use my <a href="/SmartHome/LogitechMediaServer.yaml">sample</a> as your base if you like. <pre>nano LogitechMediaServer.yaml</pre></li>
            <li>Apply your YAML so that the changes will start<pre>kubectl apply -f LogitechMediaServer.yaml </pre></li>
            <li>Check to see if your pod is up, make sure to use the correct name space!  If your's isn't smart-home make sure to change that in the command to match<pre>kubectl get pods -n smart-home</pre></li>
            <li>Last we need to check services to see that everything is running and to get our IP address of the pod <pre>kubectl get services -n smart-home</pre><p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/getServicesLMSupandRunning.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="image of LMS service up and running with IP address"></p></li>
        </ul>
            Now you're set up to start trying out Logitech Media Server.  NOTE: you'll be accessing your Logitech Media Server through a web browser, this browser needs to be on the same network as your server because we're using local addresses which are likely to be 192.168.X.X or 10.10.X.X You can see my container is 192.168.3.13 for the media server
        </p>
    </div>
    
<!--Install using Raspberry Pi-->
<div class="container">
    <p><h3>How to set up Logitech Media Server using a Raspberry Pi </h3>
        You'll need a Pi, power supply, SD card and an ethernet cable.  You will need to know how to see the IP address of your Pi, this can be done <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-ip-address/">in several ways</a>, option 1 is logging into your router and checking the address of the Pi, option 2 is logging into the Pi and running <pre>hostname -I</pre>  You're likely to see the address as either <pre>192.168.X.X</pre> or <pre>10.10.X.X</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll first want to get your pi ready, to do that you need to copy the raspbian OS onto your SD card using something like <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Etcher</a>.  You'll download the Etcher program, download <a href="https://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianImages">Raspbian</a> and then put Raspbian on your SD card.  More details can be found at <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html">Raspberry Pi documentation</a> this includes links to videos, troubleshooting guides and more.</p>
    <p>
        After you have your pi up and running with Raspbian, you should login to your pi either through SSH or with a monitor so we can do the next steps.  There is a guide for <a href="https://homehack.nl/creating-a-raspberry-pi-squeezebox-server/">Installing Logitech Media Server on a Pi</a> here, and I will tell you the basic commands.  If you need a refresher on the command prompt, make sure watch my <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQOmuLC45eoQlIMH7oCNL6yFP7kWQubBo">Linux FAQ playlist!</a></p>
    <p>
        Next you'll need to install the server, I'm assuming you have some music or audio books on your pi, but if you don't the guide linked above will also talk you through how to add a hard drive to your pi. </p>
    <p>
        The documentation for the Logitech Media Server is <a href="https://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/Debian_Package.html#Instructions_for_Debian_.2FUbuntu_.2FRaspbian">Here</a> for Raspbian install. 
        <ul>
            <li><pre>sudo apt-get install -y libsox-fmt-all</pre></li>
            <li><pre>sudo apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl</pre></li>
            <li><pre>sudo apt-get install -y libsox-fmt-all libflac-dev
            </pre></li>
            <li><pre>mkdir -p /sources</pre></li>
            <li><pre>cd /sources</pre></li>
            <li><pre>sudo wget -O logitechmediaserver_all.deb $(wget -q -O - "http://www.mysqueezebox.com/update/?version=7.9.2&revision=1&geturl=1&os=deb")</pre></li>
            <li><pre>sudo dpkg -i logitechmediaserver_all.deb</pre></li>
            <li>Restart your pi and you should have the media server up and running.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

</div>



<!--Now let's start up the dashboard-->
<div class="container">
    <h3>How to use Logitech Media Server</h3>
    <p>
        First we need to open up the dashboard.  You'll need to go to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi, or container in your web browser. <pre>http://IPaddress:9000</pre><p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/lmsworking.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="image of the LMS working but before the first library scan"></p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now the next think you'll need to do is find your music.  There are some options to add in radio stations if you want, but if you have legal copies of your CDs on your server for example, you can find those and add them to the LMS here. <a href="https://www.riaa.com/resources-learning/about-piracy/">More info about legal copies of CDs you own can be found here.</a>  You'll go into the settings, and point to the folder(s) that have your music.  In my case you can see I've pointed it at my music, audiobooks and other audio files. 
        <p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/LMSsettingsforfilelocations.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="image of LMS settings that point to your music or other audio files"></p> 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that your server is setup, it's time to add music, once you go to the settings to point at your audio files, you can add music to the system. </p>
    <div id="two">NOTE: This system is a multi part system, you have the server which hosts your music and allows you to choose what is playing where, but it is NOT a player. You will need a player and a controller.  This could be smart speakers that you already own, or you build or an old android device you have laying around. This server has a web interface that I think is pretty good, but you must have a player to hear the music.  I used Squeezebox, which can work on Linux laptops, but there is a way to have it work on Android tablets and phones which I will cover below.</div>
    
</div>

<!--how to install squeezebox-->
<div class="container">
<p>
    <h4>Linux Squeezelite install</h4>
    Squeezelite is something you can install on your android tablet or phone, or your linux laptop as a way to be able to play music. Remember, the server will send music but not play it, you MUST have something with a speaker and player to be able to play your music.  
</p>
    <p>
        To install squeezebox on Linux Ubuntu will pull up the terminal and do the following steps 
        <ul>
            <li>To install Squeezelite <pre>sudo apt-get -y install squeezelite</pre></li>
            <li>To get the player up and running <pre>squeezelite -s IPADDRESS:9000</pre></li>
            <li>NOTE: It looks like nothing is happening! But do not worry, this is normal. <p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/squeezelitestartedsuccessfully.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="squeezelite running"></p> But when you go to Players in the Logitech Media Server settings you should see an option for choosing the player.</li>
        </ul>
        
I do recommend renaming your players so that it's clear which one is playing what.  For example, my <a href="/SmartHome/magicmirror.html">Magic Mirror</a> has a speaker attached so I can play music on that by following the above steps to install and run squeezeplayer, and then in the settings of the media player, I can see the options for my mirror including renaming it. 
<p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/kitchenmirrorsqueezeplayer.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="squeezelite running on kitchen  magic mirror"></p>
</p>
<p><h4>Android Phone/Tablet Squeezelite install</h4>You can also install this on your Android Phone, if you want to play music on your android phone or tablet.
    <ul>
        <li>Go to the Android store and install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_GB&gl=US">Termux</a></li>
        <li>Next you'll open the Termux app and say <pre>apt-get update</pre>
            <div id="two">(Issues? <a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Package-Management">Troubleshooting information is here</a> I Had to follow this to change repositories instructions because I ran into an on my Android Phone where I got an error that said there was something wrong with the repository.</div></li>
        <li>Now you can install squeezelite on your android by running <pre>apt install squeezelite</pre></li>
        <li>Then you can <pre>squeezelite -s IPADDRESS:9000</pre> to get the player up and running on your phone/tablet.</li>
        <li>It will look like the same nothing is happening that it does on the computer, but if you go to your Home Assistant or Logitech Media Server IP address you should see the player as an option.  Again, I recommend a rename of players so they don't get confused.</li>
    </ul>
    NOTE: There is an app you can install for $4.99USD Called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bluegaspode.squeezeplayer&hl=en_US&gl=US">SqueezePlayer</a> by Stefan Hansel Solutions UG (haftungsbeschränkt) if you prefer that, their website is <a href="http://squeezeplayer.de/">here</a> if you want more info on that. I also bought this app for testing, and can confirm it's easy to use if you prefer paying for an app over doing an install as above.

    <h3><a style="padding-top: 60px; margin-top: -40px;" id="HACS">Home Assistant Integration using Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)</a></h3>
    <p>One thing you can do to make this system more a part of your home is to integrate with <a href="/SmartHome/homeassistant.html">Home Assistant</a> if you have an instance up and running.  The official page on this integration is <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/squeezebox/">here</a>.  But I will warn you, I did not find it straightforward how to do this, so I've included a lot more details below.
        <ul>
            <li>Start home assistant by going to the web portal <pre>http://IPADDRESS:8123</pre></li>
            <li>Make sure you have HACS installed, if you don't follow <a href="https://peyanski.com/how-to-install-home-assistant-community-store-hacs/">a tutorial to install the Home Assistant Community Store(HACS)</a></li>
            <li>Go to the HACS section of your home assistant and click on "Explore and get repositories." Find and download the repository called "Music Assistant" <p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/HACShowtoaddrepoformusicassistant.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="HACS how to add repo for music assistant"></p></li>
            <li>Restart your Home Assistant <p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/HACSpendingrebootafterrepoinstall.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="HACS pending reboot"></p><p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/HACSrestartafteraddingrepo.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="HACS how to restart"></p></li>
            <li>Check to make sure your Music assistant downloaded correctly by going to the HACS section of the menu on the left of the web portal. (You can see how it looks different then before)<p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/HACSmusicassistantreposuccessfullyadded.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="HACS how to add repo for music assistant"></p></li>
            <li>Find integration from menu on the left Settings--> Add Integrations-->Search-->Music Assistant <p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/addintegrationmusicassistant.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="add music assistant integration"></p></li>
            <li>Check Home Assistant dashboard to make sure it's running, if you added a player (Like Squeezelite) you should see that running here.</li>
            <li>Go to your dashboard <pre>http://IPADDRESS:8123/lovelace/0</pre></li>
            <li>Find one of your players such as a computer, Android phone or tablet with one of the squeezelite players installed following the directions from above<p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/kitchemmirrorplayerHA.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="kitchem mirror player from lovelace dashboard on home assistant web portal"></p></li>
            <li>Rename your players so it's less confusing by clicking on the three dots next to the player, you can see them in the image above on the right of "KitchenMirror"<p><img src="/SmartHome/smarthomeimages/kitchenmirrorplayerHArename.png" class="img-fluid" alt ="kitchem mirror player settings"></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recommended Upgrades</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reorganize your Music.  The organization and tagging system that was here by default left something to be desired in my opinion.  So it would be worth your time to make sure all your music is relatively well organized into band names, or musicians or whatever makes the most sense to you.</li>
            <li>Try the <a href="https://github.com/CDrummond/lms-material">Material Skin</a> interface for the webportal. It's pretty easy to setup, you'll go into the settings on your Logitech Media Server, then enable the "Material Skin" plugin, restart the server, and then instead of going to <pre>http://IPaddress:9000</pre>  You'll go to <pre>http://IPaddress:9000/material/</pre></li>
            <li>Some of the real power in this system comes from the tagging of music, I used <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/EasyTAG">EasyTag</a> which it turns out is a bit of a misnomer because it wasn't exactly easy.  The install was pretty easy, but the tagging was a little confusing. You'll need to install the program, and then it can do some auto tagging for you, or you can go tag your collection, but you have to make sure you save your tags before it is ready. Do not forget to save your tags on EVERY piece of music you update!</li>

Speaker 1: Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're getting into something that well, it's probably running quietly in the background of your digital life right now, maybe without you even noticing it. We're talking about Linux.
Speaker 2: Exactly. And our mission today really is to peel back the layers. We want to look at Linux's origins, which are uh maybe deeper than you think, and explore this really powerful idea behind it, open source, plus how it stacks up against systems you might know better, like Windows. We've got some great source material to help us really get into it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And The goal for you listening is to, you know, quickly get a handle on this, understand what Linux is, why it's so important, even if it's often invisible, and just get a sense of its impact, and where it's heading. You'll know a lot more about it pretty soon. Okay, so let's unpack this a bit because I think for a lot of people, Linux sounds like maybe something nerdy for developers, maybe kind of new, but the story, as our sources show, it actually goes way, way back, much further than the 1990s.
Speaker 2: That's the really fascinating part, isn't it? I mean, yes. And Tvault, he created the Linux kernel, that core piece back in the '90s. That's true. But the ideas, the concepts behind operating systems like this, that work goes all the way back to the 1960s.
Speaker 1: Seriously.
Speaker 2: So the Linux we know, yeah, '90s, but its family tree, its conceptual roots are much older, much deeper than most people realize.
Speaker 1: And it even has that famous mascot, right? The penguin, Tux.
Speaker 2: Tux. Yeah, the cute little penguin. But, you know, just as important as Tux, maybe more so, was this huge decision Lionus Torbalds made. He decided not to sell Linux. He released it as open- source and that choice well it basically set Linux on this totally unique path completely different from how most software was developed back then.
Speaker 1: Right and that open source idea that's where it gets really interesting I think it's not just about how the software is licensed it feels like a whole philosophy almost a different way of thinking about creating things well that brings up the big question what is open source exactly and why was it such a gamecher for Linux?
Speaker 2: Well our source has explained it really well. It's basically like saying, "Look, here's the code I wrote. You can see it. You can use it. You can even change it if you want and share your changes. It means the code is out there, totally open. Anyone can look at it, work on it, build on it together. It's collaborative". Exactly. And that fosters this incredible community. You get thousands of people, volunteers from all over the world, adding their own improvements, fixing bugs, sharing ideas. It's driven by this attitude of uh Hey, I built this cool thing for myself. Maybe someone else could use it, too. Let's share it. It's this massive collective effort.
Speaker 1: And that sharing aspect usually means the software itself is free, right? Like you don't pay for Linux itself,
Speaker 2: But there's a nuance there. Our sources point out developers can charge for support. That's a key point. The software might be free, but if you need help setting it up or, you know, guaranteed support for your business, then companies can charge for those services. It's a way to make it sustainable.
Speaker 1: Okay, that makes sense.
Speaker 2: And think about the global imp impact of this free code idea. It makes really powerful software available to everyone. Think about places where say a Windows license costing maybe $200, $300 or Adobe software at $100 a month. That's just completely unaffordable. That could be like two month salary for some people. Open- source software removes that huge financial barrier. It democratizes access to technology.
Speaker 1: So, it's everywhere often powering things behind the scenes. It's kind of hiding in plain sight. Where are some places that and that you might be using Linux without even knowing it?
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest one for most people probably the phone in your pocket if it's an Android phone that's running on Linux. Android is built right on top of the Linux kernel and that's what something like 70% of the global smartphone market back in 2022.
Speaker 1: Huge. Wow. Okay, that's an aha moment right there. So, most smartphone users are technically Linux users.
Speaker 2: Pretty much. And then think bigger like the internet itself. Linux is often called the backbone of the internet. Something like over 80% of websites they run on servers powered by Linux or similar Unix like systems. So every time you browse, stream a video, check your email, you're likely hitting a Linux server somewhere.
Speaker 1: That's incredible. And there's another stat our sources mentioned that just blows my mind. Since late 2017, all 500 of the world's top supercomputers, every single one runs some form of Linux.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that statistic really says it all about its power and reliability, doesn't it? When you need massive computing power, Linux is basically the only game in town. And besides those huge uses, you also see it in like command line systems. Yeah. You know, textbased interfaces. They're really efficient, great for servers or when you have bad internet. But Linux also run graphical interfaces. GUI is just like on your phone or a desktop.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, it's clearly powerful and versatile.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But here's where it gets really interesting again, I think. How does it actually compare, you know, day-to-day against something like Windows that most people use on their desktops?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Our sources map out some clear pros and cons, right? That comparison is key. Let's start with the advantages. Uh number one is often security. Now, partly that's because fewer viruses target Linux desktops, sure, but it's also fundamentally how Linux is built. Things like user permissions, how software is installed. It's designed to be more secure from the ground up. Plus, with open source, eyes are constantly checking the code for flaws.
Speaker 1: So, that transparency helps make it more robust.
Speaker 2: Definitely. Then there's its multi-user design. Linux was born in an environment where lots of people use the same computer. So, it's naturally really good at handling multiple users at once, which is perfect for servers and uh cloud computing. Maintenance and control is another big one. Updating Linux, patching security holes, it's generally easier because it's open. You're not stuck waiting for Microsoft or Apple to release a patch. If you have the skills, you could even write your own fix. You have more control.
Speaker 1: It's a lot of freedom.
Speaker 2: It is, and that leads to resource efficiency. Linux can run really well on older computers or less powerful ones. Think about tiny computers like the Raspberry Pi, Linux runs great on those, so you don't always need the newest hardware. And of course, the cost. Most Linux versions or distros are completely free. Big saving right there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, free is hard to beat.
Speaker 2: And finally, maybe the biggest pro for some, customization and options. You can tweak everything in Linux. And there are hundreds of these dros, different flavors of Linux, each packaged with different software, different looks and feels. Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Tons of choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so endless customization sounds amazing. That feels like the ultimate advantage, being able to make it exactly how you want it. But I sense a butt coming. That same advantage can flip into a disadvantage, can it?
Speaker 2: Exactly. And that's the interesting tension. Sometimes the pros become the cons depending on your perspective.
Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 2: Take support. Because it's mostly free and communitydriven, there's usually no official company you can call for tech support. If something breaks, you often need to figure it out yourself. Searching forums, reading documentation, You need good Google fu as they say.
Speaker 1: Right? So, you need to be willing to troubleshoot yourself. That's not for everyone.
Speaker 2: Definitely not. Then there's software availability. While it's getting better, Linux still isn't the main target for a lot of desktop software, especially like bigname games or specialized professional tools. They're often made for Windows first or maybe Mac. Compatibility can be a headache sometimes.
Speaker 1: I can see that.
Speaker 2: Hardware compatibility can also trip people up. Will your specific printer work? your graphics can sometimes find the right drivers. The software that makes the hardware work takes extra effort or research. You might need to specifically buy Linux compatible hardware.
Speaker 1: So, a bit more homework required before you jump in.
Speaker 2: Potentially. Yeah. And that ties into the learning curve. If you've only ever used Windows or Mac OS, Linux can feel different the way things are organized. Maybe using the command line sometimes it can take some getting used to. It might not feel as immediately intuitive for a newcomer.
Speaker 1: Okay. And finally, we come back to customization. Yes, it's a huge pro, but having so many choices, so many distros, so many ways to configure everything, for some users, that's actually overwhelming. It can lead to analysis paralysis, like which DRO do I even pick? Sometimes people just want something that works reliably out of the box without needing to tinker endlessly. That endless choice can almost be a burden.
Speaker 2: It's like wanting to bake a cake and finding out you first have to invent the concept of flour.
Speaker 1: Huh. Sort of. Yeah. It offers ultimate power. but demands more from the user in return. Okay, so wrapping this up, what does this all mean for you, the listener? We've gone from Linux's surprisingly long history back way further than the '90s, explored that whole open source idea, how it works, why it's powerful, seen how Linux is basically everywhere in your phone running the internet, and we've weighed the pros, security, freedom, cost against the cons, maybe trickier support, software issues, that learning curve.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, I think the big picture is that Linux represents this amazing amount of freedom and power. It's secure, it's efficient, but it asks for more engagement, more self-reliance from you as a user. It definitely challenges that standard model of buying software from a big company. It shows there's a different way to build and share technology.
Speaker 1: So really, Linux is uh it's more than just lines of code, isn't it? It's a philosophy. It's a community and it's this huge quiet force just shaping so much of the tech we use every single day.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. And maybe that leaves us with a final thought for you to chew on. We talked about all those choices, right? Hundreds of Linux distros, the ability to customize absolutely everything. Is there a point where that much choice, that much freedom actually becomes too much? Does having ultimate control always make things better or easier? Or can that sheer amount of possibility sometimes get in the way, making it harder for the average person who just wants things to, well, work? How much choice is good choice?

<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>Try one of the note taking styles for a topic you really enjoy and see what you think.  This could be anything from a TV show or movie, to a card game, Twitch Stream or even Video game lore. Pick a topic you enjoy and try each note taking method for at least 30 minutes so you can see what you think.  After, go back nd review your notes and see if they are useful and you would refer back to them.  If you wouldn't, why not? What is missing? What worked? What didn't?</li>
        <li>Try each of the study methods.  Go through any of them that sound appealing to you and try them out for at least 1 day.  Then review your day, what worked? What didn't? Were you more productive? Why or why not? </li>
    </ul>

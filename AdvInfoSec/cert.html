    <ul>
        <li>What is CERT/CSIRT?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)</li>
                <li>Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)</li>
                <li>Went from CERT to CSIRT to panic people less</li>
                <li>CSIRT is usually housed/run by the SOC (Security Operations Center)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Types of CSIRT you might see</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>National CSIRT</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>US-CERT run by DHS (the Cyber Security Division</li>
                        <li>CERT-CC combo of DARPA and Carnegie Mellon</li>
                        <li>FIRST Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>More Local CSIRT</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Companies need them too</li>
                        <li>Every company no matter how small should have a plan</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Security Operations Center(SOC)</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Larger companies might have a CSIRT and a SOC.</li>
                <li>Smaller companies with dedicated IT might have only a NOC (Network Operations Center) that does double duty as a SOC</li>
                <li>A SOC is for detection, containment and remediation of threats will happen.</li>
                <li>A SOC is created when there is a lot of sensitive data is being handled, or because of industry or government that says you need one</li>
                <li>Some SOCs are 24/7 some are regular 9-5, some have on call options, totally dependent on the company and its needs</li>
                <li>Government branches will generally have a SOC because of the threats and scale of the threats they deal with</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How to decide who's on a CSIRT?</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>You need people from ALL parts of the company</li>
                <li>C-Suite (A.K.A. authority to make the tough calls)</li>
                <li>IT</li>
                <li>Sales</li>
                <li>Accounting and Finance</li>
                <li>If you don't have someone on the team to speak to what each group does, the tools they need, and the planning they have things will be missed</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Communication and Planning within a CSIRT</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Need backup communication.  If the company servers are down relying on company email and VoIP isn't going to go well in an emergency</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outsourced servers, phones and emails</li>
                    </ul>
                 <li>Everything needs to be updated</li>   
                 <ul>
                    <li>Is everyone on the team still working for the company? In the same role? Are we missing any departments? Are we missing any new info or situations that have changed?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Everyone talks and agrees what should be done in the event of an emergency</li>
                <li>Regular meetings are needed,Both for planning, but also because you need to trust your team.  Trust they are doing their part.  That goes better when you know them</li>
                <li>Checklists are the best way to plan, don't assume logical thoughts in an emergency</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Things to think about</li>  
            <ul>
                <li>What assets does the company have?</li>
                <li>Threat assessment, including risk assessment of the company</li>
                <li>Public statements, pre-write these and have several ready to go for different contingency plans</li>
                <li>What is your backup plan?</li>
                <li>What logs are you keeping? For how long? When do you go through them?</li>
                <li>What information is shared when? (legal disclosure obligations), think of sharing in house, shareholders, stakeholders, public and when those things should happen</li>
            </ul>
        <li>TEST</li>    
            <ul>
                <li>Everything will go wrong.  You don't know there's an issue until you test</li>
                <li>Don't aim for perfect.  Aim to do better than last year</li>
                <li>Schedule REGULAR tests</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>   
<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>Pick a recent cybersecurity incident from the news in the last 6 months. Say 5 things they did correctly, and 5 things they could work on according to  <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf">this checklist</a> </li>

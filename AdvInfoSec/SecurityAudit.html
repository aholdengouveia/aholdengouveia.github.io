    <ul>
        <li>What is a Security Audit</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Security audits go through the current policies and procedures and see if there are holes or things that need updating</li>
                <li>They need internal access to the company.</li>
                <li>Everyone should have a security policy, the audit goes through that policy with a fine tooth comb</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Audit vs Pen Test</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Penetration tests tell you what's seen from the outside. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your digital footprint</li>
                    <li>You don't need cooperation from the company, just the right authorizations</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Audits are what's on the inside. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>From the internals of the company are there any holes or vulnerabilities that might be concerning.</li>
                    <li>You need cooperation form the company so that you can see what they are doing, and help them make it better</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Physical Enviornment</li>

<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>In pairs, discuss one example of a policy such as password rules, or computer timeouts at your job or school, discuss what the policy is, how it's enforced, how people get around it, and what you would change about it.</li>
        <li>In pairs, discuss how you would perform a security audit at your job. If you haven't had a job before, talk about it for your school.</li>
        <li>In a small group of 2-4 discuss one industry's audit policy, first think about what you think it should be as a group, then research together what laws/regulations are actually in place.  Share with the class what you've found and if you think it's ok or should be changed.</li>
    </ul>

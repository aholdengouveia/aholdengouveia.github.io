    <ul>
        <li>What is Exploitation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Recon shows us where the vulnerabilities are</li>
                <li>Exploitation gives us access to systems/resources by taking advantage of those vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Exploitation is a precision thing, think scalpel not shotgun or smash and grab</li>
                <li>We should have a high value target (or list of targets) we're aiming for</li>
                <li>Look at the success probability and impact on the organization</li>
                <li>Remember we're the good ones! If the attack takes down the system and the company loses money, we're not doing good</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Custom VS Public exploits</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Public and known exploits can be taken advantage of using common tools</li>
            <li>Tailored exploits and custom exploits can be created/found</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tailoring requires more skill, in depth programming and systems knowledge</li>
                    <li>Known exploit for XP SP2, can we get something similar to work on XP SP3?</li>
                    <li>Zero-day is a last resort.  Most malicious attackers aren't sophisticated enough for a zero-day</li>
                    <li>These need to be tested on your own systems that match the target systems as well as you can</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Examples of Exploits</li> 
            <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Zero day exploitation</li>
            <li>Pivoting</li>
            <li>Use a compromised system to exploit others</li>
            <li>If you compromise a printer on the network, use the printer to attack the computers to hide your trail and guard against restrictions such as firewalls</li>
            <li>Also called Island Hopping</li>
            <li>Proxy Pivoting is channeling all your traffic through your pivot point</li>
            <li>VPN pivot directs traffic using an encrypted layer to tunnel into your target</li>
            <li>Appears as if the attacker is in system</li>

            <li>Bug Bounty Basics</li>
            <li>Find a bug --> Report-->$$$</li>
            <li>Some companies choose to work with Hackers rather than against them</li>
            <li>Public bug bounty programs are starting to get more popular</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/"> Public Bug Bounty Program List from Bug Crowd</a></li>
                </ul>
            <li>Public bug bounties have 6x the amount of people working to find bugs then invite only, however almost 80% are private programs</li>
            <li>Some companies start invite only/private until they are comfortable with the scary hackers</li>    
            <li>Vulnerability disclosure policies - clear guidelines for reporting</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Patch Management</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>This is a process companies use to update software, OS and applications</li>
            <li>Patch management classifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities and bugs that are found</li>
            <li>Patches usually comes from the vendor, but can also be public</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Secure Programming</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>DevOps vs DevSecOps</li>
            <li>DevOps is when you can developers who automate manually done processes</li>
            <li>DevSecOps is when you actually care about the security of your operations and have security measures in your development process</li>
            <li>DevSecOps is still new because security can slow down development</li>
            <li>Tools to test your programs</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most languages have tools to test your code</li>
                    <li>Fuzzers</li>
                    <li>Black box testing technique</li>
                    <li>Uses malformed or semi-malformed data and injects it into your software using automation</li>
                    <li>For example, your program adds two numbers? Cool, what happens if I use very very large numbers? Small ones? Binary sequences? Chars or strings? Unsigned?</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

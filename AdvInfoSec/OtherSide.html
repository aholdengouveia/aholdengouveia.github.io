            <ul>
                <li>IDS vs IPS</li>
                <li>Scripts - is this Hacker vs legitimate user vs search engine spider </li>
                <li>Snapshots - Checks of what is on the system at a specific point in time</li>
                <li>Traps and triggers such as <a href="/web/20220527142453/https://phase3.net/blogs/tech-bytes/how-to-create-a-honeypot-to-catch-a-hacker">Honeytrap</a> or <a href="/web/20220527142834/https://hackercombat.com/how-to-use-canary-tokens-for-threat-detection/">Canary</a></li>
            </ul>
        <li>Examples of traps</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Too small for a human to read text</li>
            <li>Honeytoken - Like a trip wire, seems valuable but isn't</li>

            <li>Crawler traps (be mindful of SEO)</li>

        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Email</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Image of email or @ symbol</li>
                        <li>Replace mailto with script or use code to disguise the email</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bonus: if you use an email only scripts/bots can read, it becomes a honeytrap!</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Write out email - Username AT myURL DOT com</li>
                        <li>CAPTCHA before email is given</li>
                        <li>Contact form to request an email rather than posting the email publicly</li>
                        <li>Keep in mind, anything you do that is abnormal can be difficult for accessible websites and software</li>
                    </ul>           
                <li>Company wide Name Policies</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Server names such as email03 easy to guess other 2 email servers even if some are "hidden"</li>
                        <li>Are the policies posted online?</li>
                        <li>Do they follow an obvious naming scheme? If yes, do you publish your employee list?</li>
                        <li>Email address - Example Jane Doe Jane@company.com jdoe@comapny.com jane.doe@company.com are all very common policies and easy to guess (and generate with a short command) with an employee list</li>
                        <li>Consider using generic emails CEO@acmecorp.comâ€‹
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                <li>Job descriptions, do you list the products you use?</li>
                <li>Do you list your AV and networking needs in your job postings? If yes it's easy to guess your setup</li>    
            </ul>        

        <li>DNS</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Split DNS for public and private access</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Public should only show public facing servers</li>
                        <li>Private should show ONLY what's in network</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Disable Zone transfers - Zone transfer means you replicate the DNS database across a set of DNS servers.  BIG NO NO to allow this</li>    
            </ul>

        <li>System Hardening</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Ports - What's open? Is that still needed?</li>
                <li>Services - What's running? Is that still needed? Can you get rid of it? Any extras on the system is one more potential vulnerability for a hacker to find</li>
                <li>Patch Management - What is your update cycle? Patch cycle? How often do you audit your systems?</li>

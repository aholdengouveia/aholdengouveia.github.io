<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>Vulnerability disclosure, how and when should researchers disclose vulnerabilities to companies? Should governments be forced to disclose vulnerabilities they've found? What responsibilities should the companies have after the disclose has been made? On a similar note, should researchers be forced to disclose their names and locations when they send in bugs? or is there any reasonable expectation of anonymity?</li>
        <li>Resource allocation, if a non-profit can afford to make a medical device (pacemaker, insulin pump) but they don't have budget for a security professional should they still make the device?  What if they are sharing it with low income people who couldn't afford one otherwise but they want wi-fi included?</li>
    </ul>

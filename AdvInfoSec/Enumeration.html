    <ul>
        <li>What is enumeration</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is where we use the info gathered during the Recon process</li>
                <li>Enumeration is capturing and tracking info on to help us make the battle plan</li>
                <li>The data that is gathered is used during the next phase of the process, exploitation</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Choosing Targets</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Jobs (CFO, CEO, VP...)</li>
            <li>Servers</li>
            <li>Devices</li>
            <li>People</li>
            <li>Examples of Information we might gather</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usernames</li>
                    <li>Hostnames</li>
                    <li>IPtables and routing rules</li>
                    <li>Services, settings, configurations</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Layers of a battle plan</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>We don't want to put all our "eggs" in one basket</li>
            <li>Prioritize based on liklihood of detection and work from least likely to be detected</li>
            <li>Including time in your plan</li>
            <li>The deeper we go into the systems the more info is gathered</li>
            <li>It's important to look at what we're going after, how we're going after it, and how we cover our tracks along the way</li>
        </ul>
        <li>People targets: Social Engineering</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Phishing emails</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emails can focus on a specific person (hobbies, interests etc)</li>
                    <li>Emails can focus on company wide concerns, ISO cert warnings, sales quotas, or things like health care plan updates.  Pick things people are likely to click on</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Vishing</li>   
                <ul>

                </ul>
            <li>Social media</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>People are unlikely to expect  attacks on their personal social media</li>
                    <li>It's easy to overshare on social media</li>

<!--Discussions and activities for the topic-->
<p>Suggested Activities and Discussion Topics:
    <ul>
        <li>In pairs pick 2 people, jobs, devices or other items and give an evaluation of if they are a good target.  Make sure to include both pros and cons. </li>
    </ul>

\subsection*{Pick a breach that happened in the last 2 years and write an analysis of how well they did compared to the best practices. Make sure you include why you think your chosen breach matches or doesn't match best practices, this should include proof such as screenshots of social media, links to news articles, interviews and press releases from your company.}
There is a sample draft of best practices according to the federal government attached to this lab.  There is also a sample White Paper on breach disclosure that you should look at as well to help your analysis.  If you would like to look at some well known data breaches to get an idea of what to look for here are some example breaches (that you shouldn't use because they are too old):

        \item TJX \url{https://www.computerworld.com/article/2544306/tjx-data-breach--at-45-6m-card-numbers--it-s-the-biggest-ever.html}

    \end{itemize}



\section*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Turn in a document that includes a link to your chosen breach
    \item Proof of why/why not they met the best practices including specific references to PR releases, news articles and social media
    \item  A point by point analysis of how they did, include some suggestions about what they could have done better in your opinion (don't forget to include why you have that opinion and backup your opinion with other expert opinions. "Uhhh because?"  Isn't a good reason to have an opinion in this case)
\end{itemize}
